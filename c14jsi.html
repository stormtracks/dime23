Valley River Mall and Hb got some stuff at Macy&rsquo;s and I bought some goggles to go swimming. &nbsp;We messed up getting back on the Highway, and the key is to go over the bridge to get on the

digging up some black berries. &nbsp;I think for now I am good working on this stuff. &nbsp;As long as I have them held back and maintained I don&rsquo;t think I have to dig them all up. &nbsp;Think of the Buffalo, people were possessed at the time of killing all of the buffalo, I don&rsquo;t want to be too possessed of digging up all of the black berries, until there is another option there that makes more sense. &nbsp;Remember, you can&rsquo;t over think or be smarter than Mother Nature.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Wednesday 09</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hb and I went to a talk at OSU on the health of our lakes in the USA. &nbsp;The woman from the EPA talked about measuring the health via isotopes. &nbsp;Prior to the talk we went to the public library and I

the big park block. &nbsp;Only this time at the top of Fork St where the steps are we dropped down and walked up the &ldquo;hill&rdquo; in the park, last time I came down from the top of the hill. &nbsp;When you come out at the point where Ashland Loop and Glenview meet just a bit south of there you drop back down into the park right where those converters are there are steps. &nbsp;You go down the steps and then make a left and that takes you down to the stream. &nbsp;The walk back on the stream was lovely. &nbsp;We got back home and Peter had just arrived at our door step. &nbsp;We had a

our new favorite spot in Eugene which is the shops on 5th Street. &nbsp;Jim Sigman turned us on to this place when we went to the French restaurant with him and Sam for Erev Yom Kippur. &nbsp;Hb found a store called Mindys where she bought felt for her medicine bags. &nbsp;Had a nice drive home at dusk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Saturday 27</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Walk in the morning on the loop from Peter&rsquo;s parents house around the block to Brookhaven and back. &nbsp;Its a great loop that circles the country club. &nbsp;Spoke to Peter Day on the walk and Nick Skezas upon our return. &nbsp;It has literally been years since Nick and I have spoken, but the cool thing about time is that the warp of life makes it seem like yesterday.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sunday 28</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Watched &ldquo;Night Train to Lisbon&rdquo;. &nbsp;Earlier in the day we went up to Albany. &nbsp;Originally the plan was to go out to lunch but after stopping into Novaks Hungarian Restaurant we passed and went to Target to buy some light weight white socks and walmart to buy some long underwear. &nbsp;We then drove back to Corvallis and had lunch at our favorite Japanese restaurant. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Monday 29</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Spoke to Stu Cohn in the morning. &nbsp;Also, Naj and Phoenix stopped by our house for the first time. &nbsp;They are having a party tomorrow evening at the Odd Fellows Hall. &nbsp;At dusk I went for a walk out to the end of Williamette Landing and swung around the circle. &nbsp;My furthest destination was the &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; to Kiger Island.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tuesday 30</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Great party at the odd fellows hall. &nbsp;Phoenix and Naj had a nice end of the year gathering. &nbsp;A good time was had by all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Wednesday 31</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The final day of the year. &nbsp;I had a long talk with Peter Day in the morning. &nbsp;He had just returned home from a 10 day trip to Santa Fe. &nbsp;Then a long talk with M &amp; D, I sat in the car on a bright cold, sunny afternoon. &nbsp;Hb and I went to see a movie called &ldquo;Wild&rdquo; about the PCT, Pacific Crest Trail, and a woman who did the whole trail by herself.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
