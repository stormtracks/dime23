3</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We are on a roll here. &nbsp;I got a nu-crate up and running. &nbsp;I will now have the ability to put all of my iox commands inside their own crate. &nbsp;This is a gigantic advance forward along with last evenings victory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Saturday July 2</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At the end of the night just before I took my shower I got iox sql commands integrated into nushell and displaying the csv tables from iox inside the nushell Value system tables :)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Thursday June 30</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The last day of June and iox and nushell are finally working together at a bare bones level but the crates of both repos are now integrated and talking to each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tuesday June 28</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So this took me awhile to think about and figure out but I believe the way to go is to have nushell be the application that talks to iox, as opposed to bundling nushell inside iox at the command level similar to the way iox sql is working now with a Repl.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Reason being if you look inside a command like</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">influxdb_iox/src/commands/debug/namespace.rs</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">you will see that all it does is delegate out to influxdb_iox_client and this is the case for all of the iox commands that are not actually running the server but rather getting data from a running server...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So based on this idea nushell&#39;s commands will talk through influxdb_iox_client</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Plus for starters this approach is much simpler as it means that you are tweaking out nushell with iox stuff rather than trying to shoehorn nu into iox.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If later down the road there is a lot of interest then we can explore adding this extra layer of indirection. &nbsp;But by that time most of the nushell command work will be done and then it will be simply a task of breaking nushell outside its box and putting it inside the iox box.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Wednesday June 22</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Nailed

started working on it on January 7. &nbsp;That is freaking crazy, but the key point is you hung in there and came up with a relatively nice solution. &nbsp;The hard points were finally understanding the vec.sort_by needs to receive an Ordering. &nbsp;Also challenging was my lack of understanding on how exactly Result and Option worked. &nbsp;My breakthrough was working out the details in the rust-examples vec directory and then porting across the concepts to engine-q and now nushell. &nbsp;Lets work on something else !!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p

class="c0">&nbsp;by onthebridgetonowhere and then quickly landed my PR on the floats part leaving the error handling and processing for another day :) &nbsp;But its great to know that for the most part this whole mega job of getting sort-by to work is behind. &nbsp;I will continue to hone and understand better how to approach this problem from the error reporting point of view.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">It is slightly tricky because of the &#8203;&#8203;</span><span class="c14 c5">vec.sort_by(|a, b|)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;being in there. &nbsp;Normally you don&#39;t have to work around how you deal with the errors on the side of the library. &nbsp;But JT told me today that once you make that call to vec.sort_by there is nothing you can do from there on out. &nbsp;Meaning you want to do most of your processing up front prior to making the call into the library.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Monday Jan 24</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Learned today that the HashSet is what is going to give me the ability to figure out what

23</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So a few hours later I spoke to JT and he said go ahead and land it. &nbsp;Then I discovered a bunch of issues that are broken, which is ok...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Saturday Jan 22</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">I finally landed sort_by without floats. &nbsp;It took me two weeks to do. &nbsp;I thought it was 3 weeks but actually it looks like I started working on it around January 7. &nbsp;This one was a real bitch, mainly because it took me awhile to understand about </span><span class="c12">Ord</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;blocking things if I don&#39;t dive down into the underlying Primitive value that feeds into coerce_compare. &nbsp;Also, initially I was not using vec.sort_by(). &nbsp;The nice thing about this sort implementation is that it does not require an Ord as the other sorts in vec do. &nbsp;It appears I am still up against Ord with float but that is TBD. &nbsp;At least I landed something that is respectable and we can see where it takes us. &nbsp;Another HUGE issue with the past 2 weeks is that I got sucked into the old nushell implementation and was going down that rabbit hole for days instead of just solving the problem from first principles. &nbsp;But any who, hindsight is 20/20 and we are over part I of the line :)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Thursday Jan 20</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So I started over today on sort_by and pretty much now understand what is going on. &nbsp;It looks like Ord has to be implemented on Value and I will still investigate if I can grab an Int or Float or String and sort on that instead of Value. &nbsp;But that is the last peg to drop (mas o menos).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tuesday Jan 18, 2022</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I am still working on sort_by

class="c0">&nbsp;in record time from inception to landing. &nbsp;Last evening I had a long chat with JT and Darren about this whole nu-json crate and then when I woke up I realized and implemented a simple line of code inside the nu-json crate called in ser.rs called to_string_raw. &nbsp;When you nail it, you know it has to be simple and this turned out to be a trivial change and in my mind initially it was a big cf as noted yesterday. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tuesday Dec 21</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Working on the

class="c0">Learned today in our weekly meeting that JT is moving back to the USA for awhile and will be living with his parents in Virginia. &nbsp;He has been in New Zealand for five years. &nbsp;I finished off the nth command today, and it turned out to be easier than I had first thought once I wrapped my head around the Iterator.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p

whole big giant polars / arrow stack. &nbsp;also as can be seen from the previous entry JT and I discussed this issue a day or two ago; and then yesterday morning as I was weighing on my reedline nu-completer project it came to me that why not bust up nu-protocol and have the nu-parser dependencies be separate. &nbsp;I mulled this idea for a few hours and then ran it by JT and at that moment all of the stars aligned </span><span class="c3"><a class="c6"

his response</a></span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;So we are full steam ahead on two fronts. &nbsp;One is to better understand engine-q and two is to use engine-q as another test bed for getting all of the nu-completer stuff up and running in engine-q in parallel with nushell. &nbsp;This is very cool and why I still like my job at age 60 :)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p

back the other day and found out that the first day I started programming in Rust was on Scott&#39;s birthday 2019. &nbsp;It has now been well over a year and I consider myself a bit more than a beginner, but at least I am still focused on the language, and becoming more knowledgable. &nbsp;Today I came back in once again to review Chapter 13 of the Rust Book on closures and iterators. &nbsp;They are all over the nushell code and so I need to fully understand the concepts. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sunday Oct 25</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I learned today that mdbook allows us to copy the complete theme directory over to your local mdbook repo where you are creating the book and then it will use those themes instead of the default ones in the binary. &nbsp;This means that I don&#39;t need to have my own custom copy of mdbook lying around but can simply embed the theme files I need for each particular mdbook repo that I create. &nbsp;So even though the odd fellow mdbook needs some changes, another mdbook may want other ones.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Saturday Oct 24</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Worked on a website for Bonnie and Oddfellows and had some minor breakthroughs. &nbsp;First I decided to use mdBook and was able to fix the sidebar so it stayed open by default and reduced the sidebar from 300px to 200px giving the user a lot more realestate on the right side. &nbsp;I like mdBook and will continue to use it more and more in other projects; plus it is written in Rust !</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Thursday Oct 22</span></p><p class="c2"><span

at it since I started working on nushell back in July 2020. &nbsp;Its amazing how all of this stuff doesn&#39;t really stick around in my brain until I relearn it or re-remember it again.</span></p><p

messages either to a file or to the console. &nbsp;It works exactly like I wanted it to. &nbsp;Once I figured out flexi_logger this afternoon I had the whole main.rs nushell file pared down and back up and running with the new logging code in about 1 hour. &nbsp;Very cool ! &nbsp;Rust logging is working the way it should, and nushell is very well designed from a logging perspective... &nbsp;Once you understand this stuff it is really trivial and easy. &nbsp;Today was an example of how things fall into place. &nbsp;However, it took me a number of days to finally get here and come up with this simple solution.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Friday Sep 25</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A week has passed. &nbsp;We are now deep into

at streaming based on our talk today.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Friday Sep 04</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Listened to most of this

over to another directory that did not have the plugins in there. &nbsp;Once I fired up the /target/debug nu version everything worked and I pulled in all of the default plugins. &nbsp;Then today I got the sqlite plugin working and started to work on understanding how the underlying plugin architecture using jsonrpc works.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span

August 24. &nbsp;Yesterday I discovered the github repo </span><span class="c3"><a class="c6"

class="c5">&nbsp;which was great to find because for the past week I had been seeing the method </span><span class="c10">parse_and_eval </span><span class="c5">inside nu_cli but it was not referenced anywhere in the whole nushell repo. &nbsp;Whenever I did a rg on it, nothing came up that was using it. &nbsp;And then yesterday I discovered the wasm demo repo by reading over the old nushell blog posts. &nbsp;Wasm was introduced in the </span><span class="c3"><a class="c6"

blogpost</a></span><span class="c5">. &nbsp;So tonight, I got run_nu up and running with a simple example which is currently in my nuwasm repo which will probably eventually be moved somewhere else but for now thats its landing spot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Monday August 24</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yesterday I started into the nushell discord which is giving me a big insight as to how nushell works. &nbsp;Today I downloaded the first version just to get a glimpse of the original ideas behind the program. &nbsp;In concert with this info, I was able to convert the ui xbrl 10q file into a table and then back into json and the whole thing worked. &nbsp;This is amazing ! &nbsp;Also spent some time looking at toml to get a handle on their very simple, very intuitive format. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Thursday August 20</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Deep in the throes of Nushell, and making HUGE progress on understanding the inner workings of it. &nbsp;Hopefully this will be relevant going forward. &nbsp;Stay tuned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Monday August 17</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Pedro&#39;s bday. &nbsp;Today I launched in a big way back into nushell. &nbsp;So I will attempt to work on 2 projects at the same time which could be a bit tricky. &nbsp;Stay tuned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Friday August 14</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Contextref in soup-xbrl is ready to be written out to a dictionary. &nbsp;Then I will do the other tags. &nbsp;Idea is to have a complete dictionary representation of the xbrl 10q / 10k file and then write that out to whatever including json, csv, redis, sqlite etc... &nbsp;We are making massive progress on this front.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tuesday August 11</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Starting to break out a new class called ContextRef. &nbsp;Will document here more what it does.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Wednesday August 5</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Decided today to go away next Monday for a week or so. &nbsp;I learned today that our shed will not be delivered for several weeks so next Monday is a good day to go away. &nbsp;I now fully understand data_processing and passing in the context_ids.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So here is whats on tap when I get back from my trip. &nbsp;I may update this further prior to departure but here goes for now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So I am just at the point where I am understanding how to grab all of the correct context and associated context_ids that I need to get certains data points and data sets. &nbsp;I will work out exactly what data points in the 10Q&#39;s are associated with what particular contexts but this for now is where all of the work will be going upon return. &nbsp;Capturing all of the data is possibly a function of getting the correct 3 month intervals associated contexts. &nbsp;That is step 1. &nbsp;Getting all of the associated quarterly data.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Once this is done then you can move on to getting the annual data. &nbsp;And lastly the 2 quarters / 6 months and 3 quarters / 9 months worth of data.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But for now just getting all of the 3 month data is not obvious as the current 2 context id&#39;s that I am pulling does appear to get all of the data and I also don&#39;t know out of all of the data points on the 10q what data points are 3 month data points and what data points are other contextrefs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Monday August 3</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">More parsing of the edgar xbrl docs. &nbsp;I now have the name of the tag along with the value and starting to work on the child tags and grabbing the context data.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Friday July 31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Day 2 of working on xbrl. &nbsp;I now understand the work I need to do to move forward. &nbsp;Be able to get the date and the context id&#39;s automagically from the file name and a particular xml element.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span

class="c2"><span class="c0">Lots of work on parsing XBRL and winnowing down the parsing for the quarterly UI files. &nbsp;We are up and running and getting a small subset of GAAP and cleaning up the xbrl parser file with just the bare essentials.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tuesday July 28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Got all of the ubnt data going back to the beginning of time from their website and archived it in numerous locations. &nbsp;Now I can dive in further and make sure I have all of the data. &nbsp;This is a great model to better understand cash flow and the other interesting notes of a much bigger picture. &nbsp;Also calculated the avg share price of UI&#39;s purchases since the beginning of time. &nbsp;They spent just over 2B to purchase almost 28M shares at an average price of $75. &nbsp;I used the cash flow statement to see how much stock they bought back each year starting with year 2012.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Monday July 27</span></p><p class="c1"><span

class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I have been wanting to do this for years, and get a better hold and understanding of how all of these numbers flow. &nbsp;I think my conversation yesterday with Lukas got me to do this today.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The main thing I wanted to see was how all of the numbers literally add up, and now I can prove to myself exactly what the heck is going on with the cash flow statement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span

class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Starting to get a handle on nushell. &nbsp;Python regex up and running removing {M,B,%,$} from fun and mcap numbers so that nushell sorts correctly. &nbsp;It doesn&#39;t like to sort with other characters in the numbers. &nbsp;Yesterday I got a handle on how to search and go back in time on discord. &nbsp;Now I can go back to the beginning of the nushell history and get a better handle on how things work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tuesday July 21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So I have been pretty busy working on some different things. &nbsp;First of all bluemesa is in a good spot. &nbsp;The next thing I need to do is start sorting all of the data inside the CSV. &nbsp;I got the mcap fundamental data from Fidelity now pretty much up and running.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What I did was download all of the stocks whose market cap is greater than &gt; 1B and broken it up into categories where the largest one is &gt; 90B and on down. &nbsp;Then I got all of those symbols sorted out and accompanying names of the companies in the redis key symbol hash. &nbsp;Then from there I was able to create a CSV file from the Yahoo Fun data. &nbsp;And then I hit the road block which sent me down my 2nd rabbit hole.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Nushell only sorts integer columns but not floats. &nbsp;So I dove into nushell to see what was up and came across an issue with running</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">cargo run src/main.rs</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I found a solution but not sure of what the cause of the problem was. &nbsp;In the meantime, I went back to take a 2nd look at alacritty to make sure I understand what that is. &nbsp;Its a terminal emulator that brings up a new window. &nbsp;Clearly, nothing to do with shells but it took me a bit of time to remember what a terminal emulator is...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sunday July 12, 2020</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10">Day 1 of
