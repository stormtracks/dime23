was coming to a close decided to look north. &nbsp;And that is where turning over rocks continues to count. &nbsp;I discovered the book over look and was blown away. &nbsp;I had a nice talk with a neighbor who lived over looking the Sandy River basin and then drove down to Dodge Park. &nbsp;It was coming time to go pick up Hb and I left Dodge Park excited to be able to come back tomorrow. &nbsp;Picked up Hb, drove into Portland and had a nice dinner at the Mexican restaurant up the road, we could have walked. &nbsp;Turns out the Hampden Inn at exit 12 is a nice place to stay.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Sunday 28</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Nice breakfast at the hotel. &nbsp;Dropped Hb off at the workshop and I headed over to Dodge Park down on the Sandy. &nbsp;I walked around there till about noon and then headed out on Lusted all the way to Gresham. &nbsp;This gave me the big tour of the area to better understand exactly where Sandy is located. &nbsp;Afterwards I had a nice lunch at Thai Home. &nbsp;One of the best Thai restaurants in Oregon that I have been to. &nbsp;From there I went to the library until it was time to pick up Hb. &nbsp;We left there about 5:30PM and got home about 7:45PM. &nbsp;It was a nice weekend.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Monday 29</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Phoenix 14th birthday

a movie about how eating plants is much better than eating meat. &nbsp;It was our first time at their house and another person by the name of Larry was there as well. &nbsp;So it was a sweet little

flight to London at about 1:25PM. &nbsp;Eight and one half hours we landed at Heathrow on British Airways. &nbsp;I watched the movie the Big Short which was not good.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Friday 08</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Arrived London at 6:30AM. &nbsp;Went through customs, bought our Oyster card and took the Underground to our hotel. &nbsp;Driving across

Square. &nbsp;We went into the hotel and then had a nice dinner at Cagneys down the street. &nbsp;From there we walked to the river and saw the sun set over the Thames. &nbsp;We walked around the

class="c1">First day of work. &nbsp;Henley gave a great talk. &nbsp;Nice Thai lunch with the group. &nbsp;Great dinner downtown near Bank. &nbsp;We did a group tour on the London Eye up over the city. &nbsp;Its a big ferris wheel on the Thames. &nbsp;Stephen Walsh told us the whole story of Ireland, the Irish Civil War and what happened in northern Ireland during the IRA time period. &nbsp;It was the highlight of the evening hearing about what really happened in Ireland from a local native. &nbsp;Henley is really nice, I enjoyed meeting him and the rest of the team.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Thursday 14</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Another excellent day of team meetings. &nbsp;In the evening Hb got back from Stonehenge around 5PM and we did a nice early dinner at the

&nbsp;I can&#39;t tell the difference between Buenos Aires and Barcelona. &nbsp;We took the subway down to Las Ramblas, changed some money and walked around. &nbsp;We had a nice Avocado salad for lunch, and Hb had some ice cream. &nbsp;We got home around 4PM and did some work. &nbsp;In the evening we went out to buy some groceries and I had rice for dinner at home along with garbanzo beans in

an older Jewish man who had lived in Davis, California for a number of years. &nbsp;He was very nice and we had a nice talk with him. &nbsp;The restaurant was good and friendly. &nbsp;At 5:30PM we headed over to Park Guell. &nbsp;We went around to get up there, and then came back down the back side and down the long hilly street back to the bottom. &nbsp;That view looking up the hill was Park Guell we saw yesterday, and now we confirmed it by walking down it. &nbsp;We had a great view of Barcelona from the top of the park. &nbsp;We are having fun here. &nbsp;I bought some blood sausage for dinner this evening.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Wednesday 20</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Monastery of Pedralbes in the late morning. &nbsp;Stayed there for a few hours, absolutely a stunning place. &nbsp;We really enjoyed being here. &nbsp;Monastery was built in 1327. &nbsp;It was sunny in the plaza of the monastery. &nbsp;Prior to that we spent time meditating in the catherdral. &nbsp;From there we went to Sagrada Familia. &nbsp;And then walked into Barri Gottic. &nbsp;We had a lovely dinner of Tapas, our best meal in Barcelona. &nbsp;We had sangria, some yummy potatoes and two different raw fish dishes. &nbsp;Tuna and salmon. &nbsp;We then went over to the Cathedral. &nbsp;Its free after 6PM and then walked through the old town and took the subway

&nbsp;The sun was setting over Mont Juic and it was lovely. &nbsp;We took the subway home and I bought 2 blood sausages, we are enjoying living in the Gracia neighborhood. &nbsp;Our trip so far in Barcelona has been lovely. &nbsp;This is a perfect time of year to be here. &nbsp;If we came back here again it would hopefully be this time of year.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Friday 22</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Learning our way more around the barrio. &nbsp;Today we discovered Verdi street which is in the heart of the Gracia neighborhood. &nbsp;We had a nice burger, fries, and salad for dinner. &nbsp;Afterwards we found a place to buy a stamp and then mailed our letter in this yellow cylinder on the plaza. &nbsp;We would have never known this was the place to mail letters. &nbsp;A basic concept, what does a mailbox look like, and you have no clue at all what to look for or where to mail a letter.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Saturday 23</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Up early, cleaned the house and left by 9PM. &nbsp;Caught the 10:45AM bus to Girona. &nbsp;Arrived into a traffic jam. &nbsp;Our hotel, the Double Tree is

street.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Sunday 24</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Major tour of Girona. &nbsp;Caught an english speaking tour of the old city, then walked along the wall of the old city on the east side. &nbsp;We caught a great view of Girona. &nbsp;We heard some music and searched it out. &nbsp;We hung out in the bar / restaurant where the music was playing for awhile and talked about our lives. &nbsp;It was a nice sunny day. &nbsp;Afterwards we walked through the old city and had a nice lunch of wine, ensalada, a salmon dish and postre all for 15 Euro. &nbsp;In Spain, they like to do the menu of the day. &nbsp;Afterwards we walked leisurely home and chilled out in the evening.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Monday 25</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Great walk up the river towards the hills east of Girona. &nbsp;We walked quite a distance all the way till the place where the freeway crossed over our path. &nbsp;Really nice lunch back in town for 15 Euros, including wine, 2 courses, y postre for dessert. &nbsp;It was an absolutely gorgeous day in Girona, perfect temperature, and sunny. &nbsp;The end of April is the time to be in Spain. &nbsp;In the evening, an hour before sun set we walked across the street to check out Aldi&#39;s. &nbsp;We then walked west in an amazing park filled with community gardens fulfilling our desire and trust that Girona is truly a cool place to not only live but visit too. &nbsp;The location of our hotel is perfect, as its on the edge of both sides of the city.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Tuesday 26</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">It was a mellow, cloudy day in Girona but we had fun. &nbsp;In the morning Hb went out for a walk and I stayed home and worked. &nbsp;In the afternoon we went to the same restaurant we went to yesterday and had a nice meal with wine, 2 courses and postre. &nbsp;In the evening I went for a walk by myself towards the south of town. &nbsp;Being back in Spain and Latin America is a nice feeling, and I am getting a good hit about being here again. &nbsp;It is just part of who I am.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Wednesday 27</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Today was cloudy but nice. &nbsp;Today was a repeat of yesterday. &nbsp;Same restaurant for our dinner, actually our third day there, and same walk in the evening straight down the road from our hotel and walk for 20 minutes and turn around. &nbsp;But this morning, while the internet was down, they only change out the internet every couple of years but today was the day. &nbsp;I went for a walk along the southern border of the park all the way to the small village of Salt which is part of Girona. &nbsp;Then across the field and back along the dirt road we walked the other night. &nbsp;They have these old dirt roads here where people have gardens. &nbsp;The system is called </span><span class="c1 c4"><a class="c2"

class="c1">&nbsp;and the word carrilet means train in catalan.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Thursday 28</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Great mid afternoon dinner in the restaurant behind our hotel. &nbsp;We had paella with our usual afternoon glass of wine and flan for dessert. &nbsp;Afterwards we walked through the park to the old town. &nbsp;Then up the hill and around the back side of the wall. &nbsp;We crossed under the wall and checked out the cool shops in the old city. &nbsp;Girona is now officially on my list of the top 5 places in the world that I have visited. &nbsp;Others being Jerusalem and Ashland, OR. &nbsp;Vail could possibly be on the list along with Camp Walden.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Friday 29</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Got up at 8AM and took the bus from Girona to the Barcelona airport. &nbsp;We had a nice dinner at the hotel and our standard glass of wine of course. &nbsp;After dinner I went for a walk in both directions from the hotel. &nbsp;Its a pretty industrial area so I did not go that far. &nbsp;In one direction towards town is the metro in 1.5km, but I did not make it there.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Saturday 30</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Up at 6AM and caught the shuttle to the airport at 7:30AM. &nbsp;It was raining in Barcelona in the morning and the shuttle dropped us off in the rain and we had to walk across the street. &nbsp;The weather the evening before was beautiful and we caught a good sunset from our room. &nbsp;It was the first view we have had since arriving in Europe, so it was nice to see to the west just south of Barcelona. &nbsp;The wait at the airport was mellow and we had a basic breakfast. &nbsp;Flight was super, and I got to see the coast of France at the channel and then flying into England saw the other side as well. &nbsp;The train from Gatwick to London Bridge was quick and we took the subway to the Angel stop. &nbsp;We got our same room back so we are happy to be back &quot;home sweet home&quot; as Hb says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class=""><span class="c3">May</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Sunday 01</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Great sunny Sunday. &nbsp;British Museum, then subway to Cambden Market and had a nice lunch with 2 women. &nbsp;One was from Australia and reminded Hb of Denise and the other black woman was from France. &nbsp;We had a nice lunch along with Sweet Potatoe fries and a nice salad in a wrap. &nbsp;Then took the bus up to Hampstead Heath. &nbsp;Wow, what a beautiful park. &nbsp;We sat in the park and watched people playing badmitton. &nbsp;We walked over to Kenwood house and then along Hampstead Lane to Highgate High and then we walked through Waterlow Park. &nbsp;We caught the Number 4 bus, but could have walked home 3 miles in one hour. &nbsp;We had dinner at our favorite Turkish restaurant where we ate last night and then walked home.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Monday 02</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Worked early in the morning. &nbsp;Hb went downstairs for breakfast and brought me back some food. &nbsp;We walked down to the museum of London and hung out there till about 2PM. &nbsp;On the way home we stopped off at the Guildhall Library and Art Gallery. &nbsp;It was a nice, free museum as well. &nbsp;Went back to the hotel and then at 5PM we went over to have a nice all you can eat buffet of Vegetarian Indian Food. &nbsp;The proprietor from India has been in business 31 years and gives free food away to the homeless. &nbsp;The evening ended on some blue sky and sun looking out from our hotel room.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Tuesday 03</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Up early, worked until Hb returned from breakfast. &nbsp;I ate my breakfast in the room and we left our hotel at 11AM. &nbsp;Got to Heathrow around 12:30PM, checked in, and left at 3PM. &nbsp;I watched 2 movies on the plane, Spotlight about the pedophile case in Boston and Queen of the Desert with Nicole Kidman. &nbsp;Arrived Seattle at 5:30PM. &nbsp;Got through customs quickly, and caught our next flight to Portland on Alaska Air. &nbsp;They did a great job all around. &nbsp;The Red Lion picked us up and we were sleeping by around 10PM. &nbsp;A big day was had by all.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Wednesday 04</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">First stop after working for a bit at the Red Lion was the Apple store in Tigard then lunch at Hacienda Real in Salem. &nbsp;Got home and our lawn was mowed. &nbsp;Unpacked and Pedro came over to hang out for awhile. &nbsp;I love the clouds and being back home.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Thursday 05</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">First day back to work. &nbsp;Henley and I had a talk. &nbsp;Hb and I went shopping in the afternoon. &nbsp;In the evening I spoke to Mother and went for a walk around the block with Patrick and Juniper.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Friday 06</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Went over to Karen and Peter&#39;s house in the evening to watch a documentary called Cowspiracy. &nbsp;We like hanging out at their house. &nbsp;In the afternoon, Hb went for a walk with Renie. </span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Saturday 07</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">I usually don&#39;t write bad stuff down here, I kind of usually let it slide but this was so bizarre that it has to be logged for the record books. &nbsp;We just got home from London and so my timing is off. &nbsp;I got up early this morning around 2AM and was meditating when I heard outside someone yelling really loud Fuck you, Fuck you ! &nbsp;I couldn&#39;t figure out where it was coming from. &nbsp;The yelling continued and then subsided. &nbsp;The next thing I knew about 10 minutes later was a guy in our back yard banging on our atrium windows saying &quot;I want to kill you&quot;. &nbsp;At that moment I woke Hb up and we got dressed and ran outside. &nbsp;Patrick and Jay were out there and we went over to Mindy&#39;s house and she called 911. &nbsp;The police arrived and we told them what was up. &nbsp;The poor guy sat against the back of my car and was interviewed by the police. &nbsp;He was on some bad drugs. &nbsp;Eventually, they took him away. &nbsp;Hb was able to analyze the message here pretty well. &nbsp;But the bottom line is to be present in your body and be in continual appreciation of where you are at. &nbsp;This is in relation to my tale from the other day on the plane ride home with Nicole Kidman being out in the desert for many years being lost of who she was and what she really wanted out of her life. &nbsp;Farmer&#39;s market in the morning. &nbsp;Pedro came over in the afternoon and we hung out. &nbsp;Afterwards I planted some vegetables in the back garden and then we went to Linda Edward&#39;s birthday party at Coho. &nbsp;It was a nice evening and we cooked sausages on the BBQ. &nbsp;Phoenix, Naj, Johng and Reenie were there along with the Coho crowd. &nbsp;I did dishes and helped clean up.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Sunday 08</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Ken came by around 7:45AM. &nbsp;Tai Chi followed by walk in the Cigam land park for

class="c1">Hb went to Eugene for a massage and to buy some oatmeal at Sundance. &nbsp;In the evening Ken came by with some plants and Patrick stopped by with Juniper. &nbsp;Juniper liked seeing Ken. &nbsp;Then we went for a walk around the block. &nbsp;We got a new window next to Hb&#39;s office so I paid her for half of it which was around $250. </span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Thursday 12</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">In the morning I went to pick up some millet, tofu and tamari at the COOP. &nbsp;In the evening, Patrick came over and we hung out with Juniper. &nbsp;Hb cut the rest of the grass today.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Friday 13</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Walk in the afternoon over to the library. &nbsp;I found a cell phone along the way

14</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Famer&#39;s Market in the morning. &nbsp;It was raining, but I had fun any way. &nbsp;I stopped by the bank first then swung by and got a water mellon plant and some spinach and chard. &nbsp;Peter came by our house and we went to Gathering Together and hung out there till after closing. &nbsp;We took Andy on a little drive around Philomath and then came home. &nbsp;I spent the rest of the day working outside getting the big side yard crop circle filled with winter squash seeds. &nbsp;It was a slight drizzle most of the time after a big rainy night and day at the Farmer&#39;s Market but it was perfect conditions for planting seeds by hand outside. &nbsp;Stay tuned as the summer progresses on how the plants are doing. &nbsp;I also planted the water mellon plant I got today.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Sunday 15</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Went to see Alice and Wonderland at the Majestic Theatre. &nbsp;In the evening Patrick came over with his nephew Noah to do some planting in the back corner. &nbsp;We hung out for awhile and celebrated the new plants going into the ground and recalled the event of about a week ago and how it affected the hood.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Monday 16</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Went for a walk in the evening and stopped by Andy and Peter&#39;s on the way

buy gas for the lawn mower and changed the oil with Hb upon our return. &nbsp;We also cleaned out the air filter. &nbsp;So the idea is to change the oil once a year in the spring, especially check it to see how clean or dirty it is. &nbsp;In the evening we went to the UU and hung out with 2 rabbis talking. &nbsp;Afterwards we ate cookies and talked to Will Werner. &nbsp;I finally learned his last

neighborhood. &nbsp;Along the way I had a nice pear which are in season right now. &nbsp;We have lots of apples and pears at home, and having a nice fresh pear early in the morning literally made my day. &nbsp;I popped into the Valley Library and had a notion that I better get home. &nbsp;I was on the 8:15AM bus home. &nbsp;Was home by 8:40 AM and by 9AM James and Henley had me on the phone and I was </span><span class="c3">fired from BuzzSumo </span><span class="c1">and off the phone in less than 5 minutes. &nbsp;It was as quick as that. &nbsp;Luckily I trusted my instinct when I was in the library and got home ASAP. &nbsp;I was going to hang out in the library for awhile and read but something told me to go home. &nbsp;I was ready to be fired. &nbsp;Yesterday was not a good day as I knew something was up. &nbsp;In fact, I knew something was up for awhile. &nbsp;Afterwards I talked to M &amp; D and then Hb and I were off to Eugene. &nbsp;I walked up Lincoln Ave, read my book Palace Walk for awhile under a tree and met Hb by 3PM for a nice lunch at Sundance. &nbsp;Afterwards we stopped by the park in Harrisburg, checked out the local Thai restaurant which we discovered and then headed back to Corvallis to attend our local Odd Fellows Meeting where I reported on my progress on the FB page which I finished off a few days back.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Wednesday 17</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Today was my first full free day as yesterday I got fired. &nbsp;In the evening Hb and I went for a walk and talked to Lee who also showed up for Renee&#39;s full moon fire circle a day early. &nbsp;Today was a bit intense as I flesh out the next part of my life on the work front. &nbsp;For my details on this topic see

we went over to an Art Opening at OSU. &nbsp;I met one of the artists whose name is Steven Vojnovich. &nbsp;We had nice chat. &nbsp;He is into oil paintings of the ocean. &nbsp;Mom and Dad enjoyed themselves and we ate some food including yummy chicken on a stick. &nbsp;Went back their hotel and hung out for awhile talking and enjoying each other&#39;s company. &nbsp;The trip so far is going really well.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Saturday 20</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Hang with Patrick in the morning and talk about possibly planting an Aspen tree. &nbsp;Took my wheel barrow over to the pear tree on Ryan and pick up every single pear and bring it back to our house and put on the side yard. &nbsp;Also, first batch of dried pears rolled off the dehydrator, very yummy and tasty. &nbsp;More drying is in my cards. &nbsp;Lunch with Peter at Gathering Together. &nbsp;It was so hot out we were the only ones there. &nbsp;Yesterday was over 100 degrees. &nbsp;In the afternoon Hb and I hung out and I did more pear processing in the evening including burying all of the bad pears in the ground.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Sunday 21</span></p><p

dried pears straight out of the dehydrator. &nbsp;It was a gorgeous late summer evening. &nbsp;Izzy and I went for a walk up Thompson.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Tuesday 23</span></p><p

class="c1">Great day at the coast with Jason. &nbsp;Started out driving the back way through Toledo and along the river. &nbsp;We took a break at our parking spot on the river in Oysterville. &nbsp;Then proceeded into Newport and got on the boat. &nbsp;It was a gorgeous perfect day on the coast, hot and sunny. &nbsp;Being out on the ocean was spectacular and I sat up in front with the captain and enjoyed the view of being out on the Pacific for the first time. &nbsp;Hb and Jason got a bit sick but did not barf. &nbsp;Afterwards we went over to Nye Beach and sat on the back porch of the Sylvia Beach Hotel. &nbsp;We watched the waves roll in. &nbsp;Afterwards we went to the Canyonway Restaurant for the first time. &nbsp;It was yummy and I had a great Chef&#39;s Salad. &nbsp;After lunch we drove home and got home about 5PM. &nbsp;We then proceeded to take a look at our backyard plants and decided to celebrate the mini harvest of the shake. &nbsp;Pedro came over and met Jason for the first time. &nbsp;We hung in the back yard and it was merry. &nbsp;Afterwards we walked over to the river with Jason. &nbsp;It was really dark, so dark that you really couldn&#39;t even see the river. &nbsp;We bonded in the dark and held hands and walked side by side. &nbsp;A good time was had by all. &nbsp;It was the highlight of Jason&#39;s journey so far.</span></p><p class=""><span

from the ocean.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Sunday 28</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">We went out to Tyee Winery and had a nice picnic. &nbsp;We stayed there till 4PM and then

Linda of 14 years. &nbsp;In the afternoon we went to the Hours Exchange and I hung out there most of the afternoon and spoke to a bunch of different people including Xan who told me about Linda Modrell, previous county commisioner for 16 years, &nbsp;who championed the Bailey Branch Railway extension.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Monday 12</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Swung by Ali&#39;s grocery store to drop off my final good big bag of Quince. &nbsp;Yesterday at the Hours Exchange Ken recommended that I give Ali some Quince. &nbsp;In return he gave a nice big bag of dates. &nbsp;From there I went on a long walk towards the top of McCulloch Peak from the Oakcreek Trailhead. &nbsp;On the trail I met Kyle who told me how cool Bend area was as well for biking and hiking. &nbsp;He said he had lived in a lot of places in the US and this place was the best for outdoor stuff. &nbsp;Prior I was talking to Bob Lind outside our house in a short sleeve t-shirt and he commented on how nice it was outside. &nbsp;I asked him if he knew Ward Nelson. &nbsp;On the way home I stopped off at the COOP to pick up some Tofu and then Hb and I went for a walk around the block and saw Celia who has very long hair and the couple Alberto from Spain. &nbsp;We discussed the similarities and differences between people in Spain and Latin America.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Tuesday 13</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Started off the day talking to Ken. &nbsp;Hb and I made ghee. &nbsp;I went for a walk around the park block, came home, and Hb and Anya went to Renee&#39;s for the full moon fire circle. &nbsp;I did not want to go as its just too cold to hang outside in the winter.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Wednesday 14</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Hb and I had lunch at the Laughing Planet. &nbsp;We like that place. &nbsp;It was pretty wet and icy on our way there. &nbsp;By the time Ken left our house in the evening around 9PM there was big time snow on the ground. &nbsp;He came over late afternoon to do the Craigslist thing as he is looking for a new place to live and we had a nice Quince dish that I made with blueberries and cranberries.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Thursday 15</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Huge fun day. &nbsp;Started out on a conference call with Laura Kiernan from UBNT. &nbsp;Then into the park and saw Kerry and Diane, and a long talk on the bridge with Mart and Peace. &nbsp;Michele told them about Mexico. &nbsp;Then met Mark on the trail riding his bike. &nbsp;We walked with him all the way back to his house. &nbsp;At Coho we saw Cecilia who took us by Celia&#39;s for a nice tamale dinner with her husband Pablo. &nbsp;It was her son&#39;s 16th birthday. &nbsp;It was a nice afternoon at her house. &nbsp;From there we went to Peter&#39;s house to help him get some wood up and running in his stack. &nbsp;He had a nice fire going. &nbsp;From there we went home. &nbsp;And I did trash and cleaned snow off both cars so it wouldn&#39;t freeze on there tonight.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Friday 16</span></p><p class=""><span

homeless person by allowing him to participate in my order as the check out lady had told him he had to purchase something. &nbsp;Afterwards I came home and cooked the turkey, stuffing, sweet potatoes, brussel sprouts and salad with Hb who wasn&#39;t feeling totally up to par so she directed traffic and I did the cooking. &nbsp;We are having Pedro and Anya over at 4PM. Pedro stayed till 9PM and we had a nice heart to heart conversation. &nbsp;I cherish my friendship with Peter and love him as my brother. &nbsp;Anya and Suzanne are the match made in heaven with the mother daughter relationship.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Friday 23</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Caught the 11AM bus using my new online bus app. &nbsp;Got downtown and went for a walk over to the university. &nbsp;Then swung by the library and hung out with Ken till about 2PM going over his computer lesson. &nbsp;From there we had a nice walk home.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Saturday 24</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Breakfast at the Broken Yolk followed by Big 5. &nbsp;I picked up my final pair of shoes. &nbsp;I got 4 pair of shoes. &nbsp;From there we went to the Village Green Park north of town on Conifer Blvd between 99 and Hwy 20. &nbsp;In the afternoon Jan stopped by to give us our Christmas present and then we hung out side with Patrick and Bob. &nbsp;It was a gorgeous afternoon. &nbsp;In the evening we watch the movie </span><span class="c1 c4"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_King&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1484022387488000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFvcd7VaP60K2euXsS1lRo3QB7ryQ">The Girl King</a></span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Sunday 25</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Beautiful Christmas pot luck at Kent&#39;s annual Troubador music pot luck. &nbsp;Met Jim Hagan and Jaya Lapham. &nbsp;Afterwards we went for a walk across the bridge for the first time. &nbsp;It was a beautiful sunny Christmas day in the Wilamette Valley and by the end of the day it was cold.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Monday 26</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Went for a hike out on Walnut at Martin Luther King, then Walmart and Market of Choice for sausages. &nbsp;Bob and Peggy Brewster came over for dinner.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Tuesday 27</span></p><p class=""><span class="c1">Hb and I cleaned in the morning and at 3PM I took the bus downtown and hung out at the GrassRoots Books reading this book about </span><span class="c1 c4"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.com/George-Lucas/dp/1472224337&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1484022387490000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE9KtPDhHObtQuUNssoHSFw1Fm1cw">George Lucas</a></span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;Then I went up to Odd Fellows for my first ever trustees meeting. &nbsp;Hb attended as well and came from home. &nbsp;Then we both rode home together at 5PM. &nbsp;
