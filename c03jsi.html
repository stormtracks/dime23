He was a poor migrant worker who was set up by the government as a guilty party in a murder. When Florida let him go in 2001 they gave him a pair of pants and a shirt and $100. He had to borrow a pair of shoes from a friend. PLUS, the state of Florida did NOT apologize. He knew other people on death row who were innocent and were executed. Please tell every one you know that our government is executing innocent people on death row and that the death penalty should be abolished. We are the only country in the western world who still has a death penalty, every other country has abolished the death penalty but us. The reason they have abolished the death penalty is because the system is flawed and innocent people are getting murdered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Friday 05</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Complete one good week of charter school work.
