class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Not sure where the right place to put this note is so here is as good a place as anywhere. &nbsp;I came up with an insight this morning that might have some merit. &nbsp;The relevance of this note is slightly tied to an analyst looking at Zillow and their new adventure into buying houses called Zillow Offers and he said that that particular business plan does not scale well. &nbsp;It might be true that programming in React / Vue doesn&#39;t scale that well either because even though you know front end development the process of developing a new project from a UI point of view requires a complete reboot / rewrite from the beginning each new project you take on whereas in the cloud infrastructure space the understanding of how to build lego blocks and deploy them to the cloud simply requires adding in your new piece of code that a particular customer wants deployed and pulling in all of the other stuff you already know. &nbsp;The modularization of the React / Vue concept is a good one but the actual implementation is still very challenging where as in the system administration world the tasks that you are asked to do are actually fairly mundane once you understand them in an intimate way. &nbsp;So the snappy, container, docker, kubernetes world scales possibly better than the React world. &nbsp;Just a theory for now, but something interesting to keep in mind.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Thursday Nov 15</span></p><p class="c2"><span

integrating the AppDrawer concept in there too. &nbsp;Just these simple concepts alone is much more detailed and complicated that an innocent bystander could possibly imagine. &nbsp;Especially

should be noted that the first time material-ui is mentioned in your blog is the post on October 3, 2017. &nbsp;And today I went back into my github repos and noted as well that indeed October 3, 2017 is the day the semiotic repo was first cloned and built. &nbsp;So I got to material-ui via semiotic and D3 after having just completed the receipt project which was my first React project in concert with Redux. &nbsp;You will note that project was quite involved as well. &nbsp;So here I am more than 3 months into material-ui and by the time I get back from Florida it will be 4 full months working on material-ui pretty much exclusively. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sunday January 7, 2018</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Understanding concept of Context in React and how it works. &nbsp;This has taken a bit longer to figure out then it should have. &nbsp;Deep dive into Next.js to fully understand better how it works. &nbsp;Since Material-ui is so closely associated with it. &nbsp;It is important that I understand it better. &nbsp;Also, eventually to get all of this code running in create-react app I will need to understand Next.js first. &nbsp;This is apparent from the other days work where I was trying to port the material-ui doc module code over to create-react app when I hit a snag with this.props.url. &nbsp;I had no idea where this was coming from until I realized this morning that its returned by default in next.js. &nbsp;So here we go forward. &nbsp;For the record I started working with React around May 1, 2017. &nbsp;So its been about 7 months so far on this path in the woods :)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span

driving towards my first project of gostar. &nbsp;Got the whole angular side working today after one long day of effort yesterday. &nbsp;So we are back up and running with Angular. &nbsp;Also made an </span><span class="c6">executive decision</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;yesterday to stick with Angular 1 for now until there is a pressing reason to upgrade. &nbsp;I spent some time on Angular 2 which was released </span><span class="c7 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id%3D12502947&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1546463254169000">48 days ago</a></span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;Its not ready for prime time and there is just too much momentum behind Angular 1, so for now just stick with that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Also, I got an email a few days back from Clara in China and she got me back into looking at the blockchain, decred and Ethereum.

raft, the concept of consensus is tightly related to the whole future work of the block chain. &nbsp;Also, the universe, with Clara as the catalyst and driver has gotten me naturally back into looking at the blockchain. &nbsp;It makes sense, you were heavily involved and invested in Noms but this concept is actually real, up and running and viable from a business point of view. &nbsp;Also, spending more time on Angular is a must, as I need a UI. &nbsp;I always have and I always will and this time around Angular just feels more right and simple for me to understand especially now that I have the block explorer up and running and talking to Ethereum and after reviewing the source code of it, and seeing how simple it is, gives me the incentive and passion to pursue down a parallel path of both the UI and the back end.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sunday Nov 06</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Understand RLP encoding in the

&nbsp;This is my first major DEEP DIVE back into Javascript. &nbsp;In fact this is the first reference of Javascript in this worklog file. &nbsp;All of 2016 was spent either in Henley land messing around with Ruby and or Golang afterwards. &nbsp;It was the need to be able to deal with, compile, and deploy contracts to Ethererum which got me back into the Nodejs, Javascript game. &nbsp;And so today I dove back into callbacks, promises etc....</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c6">March</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10 c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Thursday Mar 02, 2017</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So I am cranking along on the Solidity contracts, searching for examples that make the most sense for me to master and discovered the 3 examples on the Ethereum website. &nbsp;So now I am going to use those to implement them in Truffle and write my unit tests which should give me the confidence to move forward on being an &quot;expert&quot; in Solidity contracts with something that is relevant to what I am doing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p

the complete Solidity documentation set from the top now that I have a better handle on what is going on. &nbsp;I did this with Truffle recently and it all made more sense to me the second time I read it. &nbsp;I also got the Solidity docs now on one HTML page and one PDF document which makes it easier to read and review. &nbsp;Will use the examples in the doc to drive all of my Truffle examples for now. &nbsp;Once this is done and I complete the testrpc and web3.js stuff I should be in really good shape and could actually possibly get back into doing some Go coding again. &nbsp;At that point I will be ready to look for a new job.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Thursday March 16</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Huge progress on

Tuesday evening April 11, 2017</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Insight to </span><span class="c6">drop Javascript as a language</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for me going forward.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Thursday April 13</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Early morning talk with Dotun and Jack at Ownage. &nbsp;Spent the rest of the day looking at the Javascript version of libp2p and at the end of the day started looking at the go version of libp2p and am literally stunned at the ease of programming in Go compared to the FUCKING UGLY callback hell that Javascript has to offer. &nbsp;It is just pathetically overly complicated, and for me a SHOW stopper. &nbsp;I need to be able to read and understand the JS but actually having to write JS code professionaly is not that appealing. &nbsp;Its just not worth the callback BS you have to deal with. &nbsp;In the past number of weeks I got away from JS by diving into the contract stuff, which is reasonable and then for the past 2 weeks in Nashville exclusively looking at JS code and being stumped by hard it is, and then tonight looking at the Go code again after being away from it for awhile and going this is so much cleaner and easier to understand and write.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I am glad I spent the past couple of weeks programming and looking at the JS code prior to possibly accepting a job with Ownage and I believe the fact that I didn&#39;t get the offer letter today because of the time difference and then spending all day on the JS code and at the end of the day looking at the go code gave me a respite from possibly making the wrong decision. &nbsp;As well as my gut has continued to tell me that its not the right job, despite the fact that these guys seem pretty cool is a good sign not to go with it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This possibly reopens the idea of taking another look at the Noms code as well as the libp2p code on the Go side of the world. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/attic-labs/noms/issues/3120&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1546463254194000">And this should be another hint</a></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The fact that the Noms folks completely dropped their Javascript version of Noms after more than a year of work on it says alot. &nbsp;Here are some very bright programmers, who used to work at Google, who are productive Go programmers saying its just not worth it. &nbsp;For me, its an executive decision. &nbsp;For me, I was lucky to go down the path of Javscript for 2 weeks in Nashville and just cut my losses and move on.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And it all came to me this evening, when I went back to look at the Go code and saw that its just a cleaner simpler language. &nbsp;However, I did learn that being able to read and understand Javascript is very important, its just not the language of choice for writing professional code. &nbsp;Period, end of story. &nbsp;AND going forward long term, why not make the decision now, be confident with it, and move on...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Wednesday April 19</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And then there was </span><span class="c7 c1"><a

I first looked at it I did not understand why this was important. &nbsp;But as I further pondered, think of millions of clients out there hanging off a set of web servers. &nbsp;In the react world each has a different state system in their Redux. &nbsp;That is not related in any way to Redis. &nbsp;I was trying to store that state in Redis which makes no sense. &nbsp;The idea would be to think about which parameters you want their session to store, think banking application or trading application but not store the entire state which is what Redux does. &nbsp;So all of these ideas are coming into my head and I am starting to appreciate why Node.js / Express is such an important concept to be an expert in / with the relationship to know where Redis fits into the picture and where Redux

class="c0">Completely re-read the redux docs again and this time I think it is starting to sink in along with understanding static propTypes when defining a new Component. &nbsp;Its amazing how this stuff is so subtle and it wasn&#39;t obvious to me that those are the parameters / properties that get passed into the React component. &nbsp;In either case I am feeling better about all of this stuff.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Monday August 7</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I &quot;think&quot; I finally got React and Redux. &nbsp;I launched into the whole React ecosystem initially around May 1, but diverged in the Graphql / Dgraph ecosystem and then got back into React around the very end of June / early July. &nbsp;So its been about 5 - 6 weeks of full time study of React.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Wednesday August 09</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Starting to work on shopping cart redux example. &nbsp;Part I was to eject the code from create-react-app which is the standard for most off the shelf examples in redux and react and then move forward with the server.js / express way.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Thursday August 10</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">All day on getting a &quot;Remove Button&quot; to work on the out of the box Redux Shopping cart example. &nbsp;Good progress on this, and realized in the early evening that I had to pass in my removeFromCart function PropTypes function because I was passing it into CartItem and it had to be passing into the CartContainer. &nbsp;Seeing this is the WHOLE reason why I am doing all of this work. &nbsp;There is no other way to figure this stuff out then do the work. &nbsp;I like UI development because it is fairly easy and you can do some cool stuff with it. &nbsp; And there is just so much demand for people who have these skills compared to doing back end development work.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Friday August 11</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So I finished the shopping-cart-remove repo which is the redux shopping cart example with my additional remove button. &nbsp;this was a very nice little short, and sweet project. &nbsp;It was my first &quot;major&quot; redux project, and should be a nice starting point for getting into the next phase which will be dealing with possibly reactabular.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Monday August 15</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Committed code to redux/examples/shopping-cart to add remove button to code. &nbsp;Start working on the tests which failed when I did the commit. &nbsp;I forgot to deal with the tests, and its the first time looking at how to test react code. &nbsp;So that is my next thing to learn and do.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Wednesday August 16</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So I came up to speed on the </span><span class="c7 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/blob/master/docs/api/shallow.md&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1546463254219000">Enzyme</a></span><span

class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Wednesday August 30</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Mom and Dad are leaving today. &nbsp;I got some good work done while they were here. &nbsp;I finally wrapped up round one of the </span><span class="c1 c7"><a class="c4"

was getting the state correctly injected into reactabular and understanding how to do that. &nbsp;Now that its completed, I can move on to the whole shopping cart / table ecosystem of saving data to redis and mongodb, a front end inventory control system, and a back end receipt system showing the receipts from each checkout. &nbsp;In other words a complete store. &nbsp;And this will enable other table driven concepts like buying and selling financial instruments and keeping track of the orders, and showing monthly statements etc. &nbsp;This is simple minded stuff, but great infrastructure code to better acquaint yourself with all of the issues surrounding redux, reactabular, mongodb, redis, react.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9

few days looking at Passport apps which I did. &nbsp;That is in a good place, along with the simple process of talking to Mongo as well via Mongoose. &nbsp;I am now ready to continue on my develpment path but also to </span><span class="c9 c6">move ahead on looking for a job</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So here we go with a big push to find the right job. &nbsp;I am ready. &nbsp;I have been &quot;in school&quot; for the past year and passed all of the courses, done the homework, and passed all of the tests. &nbsp;We are now officially ready to get to work. &nbsp;The only thing standing in your way is &quot;finding the right job&quot;. &nbsp;Quickly filter out stuff that isn&#39;t right and only go with stuff that is in your heart and feels right.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Thursday Sep 7</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Got lodash up and running in the es6 environment and then used </span><span class="c9 c6">omit</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to modify &quot;removing&quot; items from the cart. &nbsp;This enabled the tests to start working as well. &nbsp;So this is actually a fairly big step forward as I now have access to all of the </span><span class="c9 c6">lodash</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;functionality inside my

class="c3"><span class="c0">It took me about 20 days to fully get receipt up and running. &nbsp;But at around 4PM today I finished this project. &nbsp;I basically started working on this project on August 9; and last night I had a big breakthrough on how the flow of redux works. &nbsp;The event fires and updates the state tree and you connect the change in the state tree of redux to your react components. &nbsp;And in summary, it took me months to digest and get this very simple point. &nbsp;But last night I think I finally got it and understand. &nbsp;And that led to the conclusion of my receipt project today.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Thursday Sep 21</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Deployed receipt to gh-pages via

class="c0">Friday Sep 22, 2017</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Begin working on d3 project and coming back up to speed on d3. &nbsp;Back on May 2 when I initially launched into this whole React ecosystem you will note from my log that my whole intention initially was to possibly work on d3 as well. &nbsp;And here we are almost 5 months later having completed the initial groundwork with React and so part two in this whole react roll out is to look at d3 and possibly other graph visualization libraries. &nbsp;Now that the receipt work is done, it was a moment to ponder and choose my next step and part of me once again considered the whole ethereum world with truffle, but for now, unless I get hired by someone doing crypto I am going to move forward with graphs and data visualization.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Wed Sep 27</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So I got the concept of a menu up and running using pure.css. &nbsp;React Router is well understood now as well. &nbsp;When I upgraded react-redux-d3 from the old code to the new I needed to learn about react-router as they changed the way the code worked in V4. &nbsp;So I blended react-router with pure menus in my new aspen release. &nbsp;Also, I understand the concept of a Navbar and what it is in the concept of the refresh button which must stay at the top even as the D3 graphs scroll down the page forever. &nbsp;The Navbar concept is pretty cool. &nbsp;Yet another reason to be up to speed on how CSS works, as it is a mission critical piece of the &quot;front end&quot; puzzle.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Tuesday Oct 3, 2017</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So we are now on to my first D3 framework which is called Semiotic. &nbsp;Its a good one and the author is good too. &nbsp;He wrote a book on D3, he works at Netflix and his code is good. &nbsp;And I discovered yesterday he is using Material Design React components for the CSS layer. &nbsp;Very cool. &nbsp;I like the menu folding concept, it just feels right to me. &nbsp;So moving forward the CSS design concept along with D3 as the application is a good combination. &nbsp;Move foward with data visualization, React, D3 and CSS. &nbsp;Do not do Python for now. &nbsp;That is on the back burner until after you land your first job doing front end development, unless someone wants to hire me to write Python code. &nbsp;Also, spoke to Habib Moody yesterday from Literably. &nbsp;I told him I wanted a job and not to be a one off worker for his pet project of statistics on his data in a 50 table Postgresql db getting it via Python.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Wednesday October 11</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So we are hard at work on understanding Semiotic. &nbsp;Both as an end user and as a developer. &nbsp;On the developer side of the world I am now in good shape with understanding how everything is Frame and that XY, OR, and Network all return a Frame so when you look at the HTML you simply see a frame. &nbsp;Today I started getting into the individual D3 packages that are used by semiotic. &nbsp;This is a HUGE ball of wax and one that will take months to truly understand. &nbsp;So don&#39;t get too defocused on D3 in and of itself but be slightly more general with React and then have D3 as a speciality. &nbsp;So I guess that is true for all of the data visualization field.</span></p><p

framework of their react components.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sunday October 29</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So we are getting ready to leave for Ashland and I wanted to do a quick update prior to leaving. &nbsp;So I have spent the past several weeks coming up to speed on the docs folder of material-ui which will be one of my core platforms going forward upon which to build nice new websites that can be deployed to gh-pages. &nbsp;The architecture is very clean, simple and easy to understand and is based on </span><span class="c7 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/zeit/next.js&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1546463254227000">Next.js</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c7 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://cssinjs.org&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1546463254227000">JSS</a></span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;My strategy to date has been to use D3 as my application layer upon which to develop an underlying core infrastructure initially based on the Semiotic custom framework but once I discovered that Semiotic was using Material-ui and that Material-ui was using Next.js it just all came together. &nbsp;So the next step from here is fairly obvious. &nbsp;Continue to get better at understanding both D3 and the CSS framework JSS and how it integrates all sorts of different D3 Css concepts inside the stylyzed component hierarchy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Friday November 17, 2017</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So for the past couple of weeks I have been working on react-vis and coming more up to speed on d3. &nbsp;Yesterday I discovered vx after going through the code of all of the the react d3 repos </span><span class="c7 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/stormasm/awesome-d3-react&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1546463254228000">in my list</a></span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;It took me awhile to get here to understand what is going on; and it took me looking deeply into d3 and what the frameworks are actually providing. &nbsp;Vx appears to be the most low level framework plus it is written by a guy who knows what he is doing as he wrote the Javascript guide at Airbnb. &nbsp;I have come to the conclusion that semiotic is too much and too complicated from a code point of view. &nbsp;Vx seems to be at the right level of complexity and is close to the SVG spec and the D3 Api. &nbsp;So over the past 2 weeks in Ashland I have honed a bit more my skill set with D3 and continued to put more emphasis in getting better at D3 development in concert with its integration into React.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">This is where I finish up the understanding of material-ui and start building things for it using graphql as the query language to get interesting data and put something into a website.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Monday December 11, 2017</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So I recently made 2 commits to material-ui which is kind of cool. &nbsp;I am up to speed on material-ui. &nbsp;I feel good about it. &nbsp;The next step is a conscious fork in the road. &nbsp;I could either dive deeper into material-ui or I could take all of my knowledge and start to build something. &nbsp;Something real, something that is kind of interesting and will leverage my react / d3 skillset to show something that I am interested in. &nbsp;My first foray into this will be taking another look at graphql.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span
