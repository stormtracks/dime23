He told me that life was not about yourself.&nbsp; That life was about helping other people, thats why you are here on the planet, not to satisfy your desires, but to help other people out there in the world who are not as fortunate as you are.&nbsp; In a nutshell, I believe this one statement will change the way I think in life.&nbsp; It was not until I am 47 years old, and ready to hear this message and integrate it into my life that I will continue to make progress.&nbsp;

I came across a new company called CSE run by a pretty interesting CEO.&nbsp; I am finally starting to understand how the Google App Engine works after looking at it for about one week, my first foray will be John Resig&#39;s Processing code.&nbsp; Hb and I have been going for nice early morning walks.&nbsp; Mom and Dad has their 50th wedding anniversary 10 days ago.&nbsp; I am enjoying being home in Placitas and working away like a busy little beaver.&nbsp; Roy is a good guy and a nice friend of mine.&nbsp; I spoke to David Kleiman on his birthday the other day, we had a nice chat.&nbsp; Ok, that it for the first half of 2008.&nbsp; The final comment is, you were extremely lucky to have the opportunity to spend 3 months in</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Ecuador.&nbsp;

In the evening I looked at the way Datastore works locally and how, why, and where the datastore file goes as you create local storage on your own box. This is very interesting stuff --- and a deeper foray into two things.&nbsp; One, how Python works as a programming language and two, how the GAE (Google App Engine) works.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 08</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hb and I have been going on early morning walks now for a couple of weeks and one thing I discovered this morning on the walk was that in life the more foreign languages you know the better, and the same is true for programming languages if you are a professional computer programmer like myself.&nbsp; Especially if you have the time, then its well worth it.&nbsp; In the case of Python, there is a demand for the language skills and a need to understand in order to get the AppEngine going.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 09</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, after a full day yesterday of racking my brain on how the datastore writes data to a file and then trying to view the data in the web viewer and not seeing the data, I figured out this morning how to just read the data back out of the file and see it.&nbsp; There could possibly be a bug in the viewer and thats why its not able to see the file, not sure, but the key point is this stuff is working.&nbsp; On another front, Google yesterday released Protocol Buffers as an Open Source project.&nbsp; Clearly, this was motivated by the AppEngine work I would believe, this is another major piece of IP that Google is putting out there into the world.&nbsp; James came over to fix the batch heater on the roof by turning the correct valves open and closed.&nbsp; We had a nice long talk to about noon.&nbsp; The clouds and the sky were gorgeous, and it was lovely summer day with the touch of autumn in the air, or that summer clouds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 10</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">More work on Google App Engine stuff, nice early morning with Honeybun.

After months of struggle with Hb after returning from Ecuador we call it quits on our relationship and mutually decide to be friends, not lovers.&nbsp; We have been driving towards this decision for months since we have been back but I don&#39;t think I got it in my head that it was really over, and there is life on the other end of the rainbow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 14</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Started working on John Resig&#39;s implementation of the canvas element in Mozilla, this will be part of HTML five, and is already in the spec.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 15</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Stephen Landau comes over for dinner.&nbsp;

Taking a look at MooTools and how they integrate in the canvas element.&nbsp; It looks like MooTools and the MooCirclePack is my ticket to a very nice architecture with the Canvas element which is what I was looking for now that I got the handle working Monday.&nbsp; It took me a week to get the handle example working -- but it was worth it, because it really made me dive into Javascript.&nbsp; Now with a nice new architecture in place, I may be able to drop John Resig&#39;s Processing code and then back fill things I need from it into the new architecture, we will see how things play out.&nbsp; Hb didn&#39;t get home till 11pm, so I went to bed late.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 24</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First day back for Hb and I continued working on my stuff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 25</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Skipped out on Jim Palmer&#39;s moon party, but Hb went for a short time and then had dinner at Diana&#39;s.&nbsp;

Today I will start back into working on Django and the whole Google App Engine world after a break while I was getting the Html Canvas stuff going.&nbsp; Here is a bit of history on the work I have done up till now as far as bringing all of this information together.&nbsp; On Sunday June 15, I got the SMS message from Google that enabled me to start creating AppEngine stuff.&nbsp; On Thursday June 19 the light went on in my head that the BigTable tied in with the Google App Engine stuff is going to be huge, and that eliminating the need for an Object Relational Mapping Layer (ORM) or hibernate greatly reduces the complexity of the software stack.&nbsp; Also, in perusing the web I am noticing that there is a resurgence of products and ideas in the area of object databases and more specifically the concept of scaling object databases across multiple machines.&nbsp; On Wednesday June 25 I got Guido&#39;s Rietveld app up and running on my machine, diving further into the world of GAE.&nbsp; I worked on all of the GAE stuff through the first two weeks in July.&nbsp; The culmination of my work on GAE was getting my code to talk to the datastore independent of the web server.&nbsp; I was able to read and write data to the datastore, which was a huge win.&nbsp; For the remainder of July and into early August (now) I was working on John Resig&#39;s Processing code for the Html Canvas and then onto the MooCirclePack implementation on the Html canvas.&nbsp; I am now back into the GAE and will tie the GAE and the Html Canvas work together now and deploy my first GAE.&nbsp; You will not that Google upped the number of applications from three to ten earlier in the month, and this is a huge step for me as it will enable me to deploy more apps without having to resort to doing another whole SMS account thingie.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 06</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Understanding Django well in correlation with Rietveld including how the template files inherit from the base.&nbsp; First time learning about Mechanical Zoo, I may have a call with them tomorrow.&nbsp; More understanding of how the proxy works in open social and why you need it so the client can talk to the server and then the server talks to the other web site.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 07</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">More work on the Htmlcanvas.&nbsp;

Then had a 10am call from Max Ventilla CEO of a company called the TheMechanicalZoo.&nbsp; More time on getting Portfolio keys into the datastore.&nbsp; Really nice evening meal over at Joan and Prashant&#39;s house.&nbsp; It was our first time over there and we had a great time.&nbsp; I really like David, Susan, Prashant, and Joan, they are quality people and my idea of the types of people I like hanging out with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 09</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I learned a lot from yesterday&#39;s talk with Max and also Peter&#39;s comment on following what is in your heart and don&#39;t sway from the feeling.&nbsp; My general hit on my conversation with Max and his company is a BIG thumb&#39;s down, although he probably has the same feeling as me.&nbsp; But anyway, it gives me some direction on where I should be focusing on my job search.&nbsp; Hb and I went to the Flea Market, we love doing that and then went into town to pick up a flat screen monitor at Costco with Sue.&nbsp; I then did some errands and then on to the Sun Flower Market for some food.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 10</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mellow day at home, Hb went to the Tamaya for Mania&#39;s party for Cass&#39;s two year death party.&nbsp; Hb and I tried to put together a desk but decided to put it back in the box and return it to Office Depot.&nbsp; I basically finished off the wood today by stacking it in long narrow rows.&nbsp; It took Hb and I several weeks to figure out how we wanted it took look, but now its stacked and done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 11</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I finished up the portfolio add/delete on the python unit test side and am now moving on to Django forms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 12</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lots of reading on Django forms and in general their documentation.&nbsp;

After reading over the Columbia Travel Guides and having read Evan Belknap&#39;s Central America when we watched Ruby, I am less likely immediately to jump off and go BACK down to Latin America right away, but instead get a nice job here in the US working on the stuff I have been doing since returning from Ecuador.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 14</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Making progress on Django via the Rietveld example and driving my app further along.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 15</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Did some paper work errands around the house.&nbsp; First phase of htmlcanvas in good shape, actually seeing the data on the screen for groups and portfolios.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 16</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Got the portfolio keys tied into the circle packing page so that now I can add portfolios in the admin page and see them show up in the circle packing page. Long talk with Peter about life, Mitch, Hb, and doing the work I need to do to move forward in my life.&nbsp; Later in the day I correlated that with doing the work to make Latin America happen in my mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 17</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Early morning walk with Roy at the Flying Star.&nbsp; I am coming to the realization that going back down to Latin America is clearly the call and that focusing on making it happen is what needs to be done.&nbsp; This is really the first day that it is becoming clear to me as to what to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 18</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First day of applying to jobs in Latin America.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 19</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apply to lots of jobs in Latin America, major push for applying for jobs.&nbsp; Nice talk with Mother and told her about my plans, and she sounded very cool with it in general.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 20</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">More progress on htmlcanvas and got images integrated into the core website.&nbsp; You can now save your circlepack pictures for later use and in presentations.&nbsp; Massive clean up of htmlcanvas, getting the site ready to go.&nbsp; Once that is complete I may go back to the drawing board on MooCirclePack and figure out how things are working better to be able to turn on/off the gravity.&nbsp; This will be OK, because I am going to wait to deploy until Django 1.0 is released, and then hopefully Google will put on a new version of AppEngine.&nbsp; On the job front things are really coming together on what the strategy should be.&nbsp; Clearly, I am ready to go out in the world and get a job, and look at opportunities mainly in Latin America, but also possible things here too, if its a great opportunity.&nbsp; In the meantime, I need to start focusing on the BDC structure and data analysis/visualization. All in all, things have taken a turn for the better in my life with the recent committment to looking for work in Latin America as one of the tenets to going forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 21</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wages in Latin America are going to be pretty minimal, and the telecommuting route looks to be taking off in a big way now, so that is something to consider.&nbsp; Also, looking into travel expenses to different parts of Latin America including Buenos Aires and Spain.&nbsp; FYI, just for the record books our plane tickets to Guayaquil, Ecuador from LAX on January 11, 2008 were $490.80.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 22</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Looks like PHP is huge and this is the place to be working, not in Java.&nbsp;

Found out that Plone and Zope are both CMS systems written in Python.&nbsp; It was not as clear to me as it is now that if you want to be developing web sites on the internet the clear choice is PHP, and obvioulsy NOT Java.&nbsp; In the past I have asked various people the question, &quot;If you were designing a new web site today from scratch, what programming language would you choose ?&quot;&nbsp; In the past for me it was not that obvious what the answer was.&nbsp; Clearly, Java is not the way to go for a whole host of reasons.&nbsp; Today, PHP is the obvious choice based on the number of deployed systems out there in the market place.&nbsp; I would say for now, that Python is probably the number two choice and Ruby on Rails is making lots of headway.&nbsp; But Java ain&#39;t it !&nbsp; Right now I am very impressed with WordPress out of the three (3) most popular CMS systems.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 24</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Early morning ride over the mountain from Placitas to the top of the ski basin road.&nbsp;

It took me this long to understand that on the web PHP is the ruler right now, with Java and Python sitting in the back row.&nbsp; There may be some other Microsoft based frameworks but that is not where I am focusing so here we are ready to go out there and get a job based on PHP.&nbsp; This morning I dealt with understanding how the website of Bride.com works after getting an email from Steve Kramer, steve@bride.com.&nbsp; I called and spoke to a guy in Prague, Czech Republic and was asking him about whether Bride.com is a company I want to work for.&nbsp;
