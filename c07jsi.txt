Then I shoveled out my spot on the paved road. Back home with Hb to get her stuff for tomorrow.  Her car is still stuck in the snow.  Then clean off the trees and get wood for the house.  This is the biggest snowstorm since 1959.  Wow...  The past couple of weeks have been very interesting to say the least..  Life always brings new twists and the whole concept is to just enjoy the process.

Yahoo releases the 2.2.0 version of their javascript API.
Thursday 22
Back to work.  Lunch at my house to view Andy's tile job in the kitchen.  Whole Foods buys Wild Oats for 518 million dollars.  FBR has a good earning's report and stock rebounds above 7 after settling in below 7 for a new 52 week low.
