out the day with a nice email to David Kleiman whose son Zach is getting married. &nbsp;Hb went out with Diana and Renee and I stayed home and talked on Skype to Maria about literature. &nbsp;It has been several years since we have had a long talk together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 02</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ken came over and we went for a walk around the park. &nbsp;Later on he dropped off some avocados for Hb. &nbsp;Hb and Anya went to see the Star Wars movie in the evening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 03</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hb and I drove down to Findley and went in on Bruce Road. &nbsp;Then on to Bellfountain where we walked around for awhile out towards Alsea. &nbsp;From there we headed home and in the evening we went to the Oddfellows meeting where we paid our dues of $88. &nbsp;Afterwards we had food, Lee brought his standard Borcht and Phoenix brought some nice salad and a bread.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 04</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a cold, snowy, sunny day in Corvallis. &nbsp;Around 1PM Hb and I walked downtown. &nbsp;We stopped by the COOP for Hb to grab some grub for lunch and me to pick up some greens. &nbsp;Afterwards we walked downtown, and caught the bus back to Alexander. &nbsp;I filed for unemployment today and wrote a long letter to Joe P who is now back home in western PA. &nbsp;It was nice seeing him last summer out here at our house for a spell and a nice party was had by all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 05</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Caught 11AM bus, then walk around OSU. &nbsp;At the library by noon for the Sustainability Annual Meeting. &nbsp;Ken and I walk home and talk to Linda&#39;s husband Jay about the Bailey branch. &nbsp;From there I talked to Ken for awhile about the moon and when its clear you can always see it. &nbsp;The question is whether or not its in our visibility or hiding on either side of the horizon. &nbsp;New personal insights into this topic as well as planets not actually emitting light but reflecting the sun&#39;s light was an insight recently in regard to Boyd asking me about what that was up in the sky and me telling him it was the planet Venus which has been incredibly brilliant just after dark in the southern winter sky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 06</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oddfellows cemetery at 1PM followed by lunch at the COOP. &nbsp;Then we swung by TJ&#39;s and home. &nbsp;Went for a nice quick walk around the block prior to darkness. &nbsp;Hanging at the cemetery today with Lee, Phoenix, Tim, Gene, and John was very nice. &nbsp;I like the folks at Oddfellows. &nbsp;I am in a good place with them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 07</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Big snowy day in the Willamette valley. &nbsp;By the time we went over to Peter&#39;s there were several inches. &nbsp;Earlier the car was packed in ice below snow. &nbsp;So I started up the car and let it run for about 15 minutes until I was able to chip off all of the ice. &nbsp;Nice meal with Kerry and Diane, Pedro and a warm wood stove of Turkey soup, pomegranite salad and dal. &nbsp;It was a nice way to start out the year with neighbors and friends. &nbsp;Afterwards we came home and I went out for a short walk and rapped with Jason for awhile about Abbey and how nice it was for Hb and I to have a nice conversation with her on the bus ride home a few months back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 08</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dealt with making reservations for our trip to Nashville this spring. &nbsp;We got a place to stay in Nashville and a nice rental car. &nbsp;In the evening JohnG came over at 7:30PM and stayed till 10PM. &nbsp;We went over cut and paste on his laptop and we rapped for awhile prior to the computer lesson.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 09</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nailed down staying in Nashville at the center where Hb is having our conference. &nbsp;Then bussed over to OSU and walked on the sidewalks that were NOT full of snow and ice. &nbsp;It was an ugly day to be walking around town due to the massive amounts of SLUSH. &nbsp;But I found some clean trails at OSU. &nbsp;Walked home from Alexander and 99 where the bus dropped me off. &nbsp;Finished off the diary work and cycled through purple papers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 10</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bed, Bath and Beyond followed by Walmart then TJ&#39;s and VC loop. &nbsp;It was lightly raining but not too bad out. &nbsp;The massive slush fest from yesterday when I was over at OSU is now gone thanks to a warmer rain last evening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 11</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Peter&#39;s at 11AM to move wood. &nbsp;Hang for awhile then he and Hb went to Sada and I walked out to Fred Meyer&#39;s to catch the 2PM bus. &nbsp;Then Hb and I went for a walk over to the cemetery and home. &nbsp;Along the way we saw Phoenix and Naj.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 12</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ken came over at 6PM and we went to the library with Hb to hear a talk by the Sierra Club on Sea Vents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 13</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Walk in the afternoon around the WL Block then Jan&#39;s for computer help. &nbsp;She needs to upgrade her OS, Heidi stopped over Jan&#39;s with some Macademia nuts. &nbsp;They had a good trip to Hawaii. &nbsp;In the evening we went to Oddfellows for a Capricorn party with Ken. &nbsp;I had a long talk with Stan Taylor about health insurance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 14</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Walk around Salem over to Willamette University then on to the library. &nbsp;Back to pick up Hb at Macy&#39;s and I bought a winter coat for next winter. &nbsp;Then we had lunch at our Mexican restaurant on Commonwealth and rode home to the Buena Vista ferry. &nbsp;Its a gorgeous spot on the Santiam. &nbsp;We got home at dusk and I went for a short walk around the block.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 15</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hb went to her shamanic group and at 4:30PM we drove down to Earth Rising for a sweat at Lee Miller&#39;s house. &nbsp;Jackie was in Ca for a dance group. &nbsp;Attending was Delbert, Scott {harmoniouspractice}, Joa, who I never met before, and Craig was around in the other room. &nbsp;There was a woman there by the name of Lacy who was from Utah and had spent a year in Vietnam. &nbsp;The stars at Earth Rising are always magical and the drive home on a cold winter night in the Willamette Valley we saw ONE car. &nbsp;That could possibly be a new record.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 16</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hb cleaned the house and I went for a walk around the park block with Ted Z. &nbsp;We stopped by the river dock to see the water rushing by. &nbsp;He came into our house for the first time and we chatted for awhile with Hb. &nbsp;Ted is a good man. &nbsp;This is our second time getting together, the first time was a nice Indian buffet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 17</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Up at 6AM, was in Albany by 7:30AM. &nbsp;Did the appointment at 8AM for unemployment then walked around the area. &nbsp;Home by 11AM after a short stop at the COOP to get some food. &nbsp;In the afternoon I worked with Jan to try and attempt to do a MacOS upgrade but it didn&#39;t work. &nbsp;She came back over around 5PM to pick up her computer. &nbsp;Hb went to the movie this afternoon with Anya to see a movie called Lion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 18</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Long talk with Scott in the morning. &nbsp;He wants me to be a co-founder in his company dealing with agriengineering and visualization of crop data relative to the amount of evaporation from them. &nbsp;It his is first web app. &nbsp;Hb and I went for a long walk around the park in the afternoon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 19</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Took the bus over to 49th and Country Club and walked home. &nbsp;Its about a 5 mile walk. &nbsp;The weather has gotten much nicer, meaning warmer. &nbsp;It was partly cloudy with some sun, and the walk was lovely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 20</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hb and I go down town for the rally at Central Park. &nbsp;Earlier in the day I watched Trump&#39;s inaugural speech on YouTube after the fact. &nbsp;After Central Park we swung by Odd Fellows prior to everyone showing up. &nbsp;The energy of the group stirred me and coming home was the call. &nbsp;In the evening Hb went to ecstatic dance and I talked to Pedro for a record 2 hr, 43 min, and 50 seconds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 21</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Winter Farmer&#39;s Market for the first time this year. &nbsp;It was a rainy day so we chilled out at home and ate food. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 22</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Long walk starting at Crescent Valley High School at 9:30AM. &nbsp;I walked up to the Jackson Creek Trailhead and then on from there straight crossing the stream and bridge to the left. &nbsp;Then continued straight on up the road to where it hit the Dan&#39;s Trail and the Horse Connector Trail. &nbsp;I walked up that trail and then dropped back down the Horse trail to where I started close by the bridge. &nbsp;I am learning my way around the M Forest and it was my first time doing this walk. &nbsp;I got back to my car around 11:45AM. &nbsp;Its a five minute drive over to TJ&#39;s and from there I went home. &nbsp;In the late afternoon we went to watch the Steeler game at Peter&#39;s. &nbsp;They lost to the New England Patriots in a blowout game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 23</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hb went to Albany with Anya and got home about 2:30PM and then we walked downtown and back home. &nbsp;It was a gorgeous day. &nbsp;Along the way we ran into Jim, who we met at the potluck Christmas day at Kent&#39;s music store and then we saw Scott who wrote the book on distilling in Oregon who lives in Southtown.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 24</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gorgeous winter day in Oregon, sunny and mild. &nbsp;I stayed in all day and worked and after dark went for a short walk around the block. &nbsp;In the early morning hour I had a nice talk with John Zeuli. &nbsp;It was our first talk of 2017, and keeping up my friendship with John has been important to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 25</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Went to see 2 poets at Grass Roots Books namely </span><span class="c4 c2"><a class="c5"

Sibley Williams</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;both of whom spoke to me especially since its less than a week after the Trump inauguration. &nbsp;And they were both very vocal about the state of things at this very moment. &nbsp;They also elucidated the voice and what it means to get there and have one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 26</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Drove up to Northface in Woodburn on I5, it took us one hour and we got there before noon. &nbsp;Afterwards we had lunch at </span><span class="c4 c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://luisstaqueria.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1514775574268000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE1-9vvheiw-DoSAuA7iWE789OJOA">Luis&#39;s Tagqueria</a></span><span class="c2">. &nbsp;It was passable but we will not be going back to downtown Woodburn to eat. &nbsp;There is not much there. &nbsp;Also, we realized that it was the place we went on the Greyhound bus on our first trip back to NM on Nov 2, 2013 as we were going to the airport in Portland. &nbsp;Its a strange world when you come back to a place you never knew in the first place and then realized where you were. &nbsp;We drove home on French Prairie Rd through downtown Salem and over the bridge on Hwy 22 to Rickreall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 27</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At 3PM I took the bus over to OSU and walked around. &nbsp;I checked out the new Learning Center which is an amazing building. &nbsp;I walked up to the 4th floor which is actually good exercise. &nbsp;I like that building and it would be a good place to just take a book and read and / or meet with others to talk etc... &nbsp;Afterwards I walked back towards 15th and then on home through Avery Park. &nbsp;This time I walked left and then through the trail across the park. &nbsp;A new way. &nbsp;It was a mild winter day, and in the course of the day I am reading Charles Dicken&#39;s &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; for the first time. &nbsp;What a writer, I am impressed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 28</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farmer&#39;s market saw Tal and Miriam and had a nice talk with Jeff, Maureen&#39;s husband who I had not seen in awhile. &nbsp;Also saw Luke for the first time this winter. &nbsp;At the end of the day we went for a walk around WL and down to the river and back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 29</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chinese New Year&#39;s Party at OSU at 5PM with Anya. &nbsp;Earlier in the afternoon we went for a walk around the block.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 30</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Spoke to the lady at the unemployment office early in the morning. &nbsp;Ted and I went for a walk out in the Herbert Open Space at 4PM. &nbsp;We walked till dark.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 31</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I started walking over toward Ken&#39;s house at 5PM and I saw him walking down the street closer to 6. &nbsp;We drove over to OddFellows for the potluck. &nbsp;I sat next to 2 Suzanne / Susan&#39;s. &nbsp;It was a good pot luck.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c6">February</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 01</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our first Death Cafe at noon at the InterZone followed by lunch at the new Taco Vino restaurant downtown. &nbsp;Afterwards we went to the bookstore and library and then headed home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 02</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bus downtown then walk to DTC and pick up bus 4 out to the corner of Highland and Walnut. &nbsp;Then I walked left and up 13th and up Garyanna into the forest and through the woods to the power lines which led me right to Lester Ave. &nbsp;Then I headed west and dropped down to 29th and back over to Circle and King&#39;s to catch the bus home. &nbsp;I did some more winter squash. &nbsp;I am keeping up with the squash as it goes bad from the hard freeze a few weeks back which tanked the squash in a big way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 03</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Walk in the late afternoon around the park. &nbsp;Saw Bob Lind and Linda, who&#39;s husband is Jay at the River. &nbsp;She told me about her sons. &nbsp;One lives at home and has a PhD in Physics from Gainesville and is teaching out at LBCC and her other son who lives in Joseph. &nbsp;She told me about driving across the state in the autumn and how beautiful it is and also how cold it is there in the winter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 04</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farmer&#39;s Market around noon. &nbsp;Signed up with Theresa Matteson to work at the Native Plant sale at the end of February. &nbsp;Onwards to TJ&#39;s and VC and then dropped off some old jars at the COOP. &nbsp;We have now been in OR long enough that I have excess jars piling up in my closet. &nbsp;Hb and I went for a walk around the park and got home around 5PM. &nbsp;I also had a nice chat on Skype with Jeff Mankoff. &nbsp;He is doing well and was into turning me on to Ancestry.com</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 05</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a pretty rainy day but Hb and I got out early afternoon for another walk around the park like yesterday. &nbsp;We saw Heidi and told her we went to Luis&#39;s Taqueria in Woodburn. &nbsp;We decided not to go over to Pedro&#39;s for the Super Bowl but stayed home and ate our turkey and beans, our favorite dish here on Powell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 06</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saw Mushroom and Linda in the hood and he turned us on to his video about his art work. &nbsp;Had a nice long talk with Rand and Tessie. &nbsp;Tessie came back from the Philippines, Sima went too. &nbsp;Tessie is done with her treatments for breast cancer and celebrated with a big trip to see her brother who is 85. &nbsp;Hb and I started our taxes today.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 07</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the evening we went to our first Tuesday monthly Odd Fellows meeting. &nbsp;Earlier in the day we decided and booked reservations for our trip down south to Ashland and Chico.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 08</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Long walk from the Number 8 bus at 49th back home. &nbsp;It was a misty, slightly rainy day, but I made it all the way home without getting too wet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 09</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Walk around the wetlands and heard the frogs yell on a full moon with Hb. &nbsp;Afterwards we saw Kathy Miller and we hung out with her in front of our house staring at the full moon. &nbsp;We then watched the movie </span><span class="c4 c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papa:_Hemingway_in_Cuba&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1514775574272000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENDa4lQUC-5tzkj-c6vVdl1ekdFA">Papa: Hemingway in Cuba</a></span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 10</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Walked back to the frogs in the day. &nbsp;Saw Phoenix driving along the way and he stopped and talked to us for awhile. &nbsp;It was a typical great day before travel packing up and being in the glory of getting ready to go on a vacation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 11</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Got up at 5AM and left the house by 7:30AM. &nbsp;We hit all of the rest stops along the way and was in Grants Pass at around 11AM for breakfast at Ma Mosa&#39;s which was super. &nbsp;From there we took the back road to Ashland. &nbsp;We had a nice dinner at our Pizza restaurant after my favorite walk in Ashland. &nbsp;We did the loop up to the top of the hill. &nbsp;It was a great day ! </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 12</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Got up and had a nice breakfast of eggs and home frys at our hotel in Ashland. &nbsp;From there we drove to Yreka and then the back road to Mount Shasta. &nbsp;The old Hwy 99 is lovely. &nbsp;There was not a car on the road. &nbsp;It was a flash back to the good ol days. &nbsp;We walked around Mt. Shasta, hung out at the COOP and Hb bought a rock at the rock store. &nbsp;From there we drove to Chico. &nbsp;Nita checked us in and then we had a nice dinner at the Mexican restaurant downtown called Tres Hombres. &nbsp;Afterwards we walked around the university, its a lovely town and the creek running through the university is great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 13</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Breakfast across the street at Morning Thunder then we headed east on Hwy 32 to check out the canyons east of town. &nbsp;Very cool. &nbsp;In the late afternoon I went for a walk around the university and then we had a nice Thai dinner downtown.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 14</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Breakfast at Cafe Coda. &nbsp;We walked over there, its in a cool new part of town we had not been in yet. &nbsp;Afterwards we found the COOP. &nbsp;Great walk out at the Sac River State Park. &nbsp;Afterwards we drove north on River Road. &nbsp;We met the owner of our house today sally.proctor@gmail.com and she told us she has weekly and monthly rentals. &nbsp;I walked up the street to Hwy 99 and back along the park at dusk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 15</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Great day, not sunny but nice. &nbsp;We ate breakfast at home, Pete&#39;s for coffee and a very nice Indian buffet for lunch. &nbsp;Then big walk in the walk for the first time. &nbsp;We walked past and under Hwy 99 to Vallombrosa Circle. &nbsp;At dusk I did another walk up the street to 99 and back. &nbsp;Chico is a nice town, and the place we are staying feels good. &nbsp;Long over 2 hour talk with Peter in the evening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 16</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Left Chico at 8AM and sent a text message to Sally Proctor that the dish washer was on, the house was locked and the heat was off. &nbsp;Quick stop at Starbucks and then drove to Mt. Shasta where we had a lovely lunch of a big bowl of rice and beans. &nbsp;Hb talked to her friend in the rock shop after lunch and I went for a short walk. &nbsp;From there we took the back road to Yreka and then on to our walk on the back road to the green bridge and the Shasta River. &nbsp;We walked down into the canyon and it was sunny and warm; Hb and I decided to have our ashes thrown at the bottom of this canyon. &nbsp;It was great to be there. &nbsp;We landed in Ashland around 4PM, checked in, in sun. &nbsp;Awesome dinner at Thai Pepper. &nbsp;It was good. &nbsp;Afterwards we bought Quinoa at the COOP for $2.13 and then went home to watch the Trump Press Conference.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 17</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Great breakfast once again at the Ashland Springs Hotel. &nbsp;Wow, the eggs and potatoes are straight from the kitchen downstairs at Larks. &nbsp;Yummy. &nbsp;We left at 9:30AM and got on I5 in Grants Pass at 11:30AM and were at the COOP in Eugene around 2PM. &nbsp;Going through Medford, Gold Hill etc is not the call, but oh well. &nbsp;We bought our food at the COOP and ate our lunch at Whole Foods. &nbsp;We drove home the back way on Coburg Road and were home with plenty of light. &nbsp;Patrick and Juniper greeted us and we were tucked in for the evening before dark. &nbsp;It wasn&#39;t even cold in our house and the hot water heated up quickly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 18</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Back into working on taxes, did downloads of data etc... &nbsp;Farmer&#39;s market around noon, first stopped by the PO and picked up our mail. &nbsp;In the afternoon we did the frog walk, and then down to the river.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 19</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cooked all day for Ken and Pedro who came over for dinner. &nbsp;Ken brought sunchokes, which are pretty good. &nbsp;I went for a walk about an hour before they arrived around the block twice. &nbsp;It was a nice dry afternoon and I enjoyed the walk. &nbsp;Ken is still looking for a place to live but I believe is getting closer to finding a place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 20</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Walk late in the day around WL. &nbsp;Upon arriving home I had a nice talk with Patrick and Mindy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 21</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Never left the house, working on Ether contracts first couple of days. &nbsp;Spoke to Mom and Dad in the evening, Mother specifically about her going to Phoenix and meeting up with Rick there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 22</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Spoke with Alex Wearn about a job then took the bus downtown, mailed at letter at the PO, went to the bank and then walked home stopping at the COOP on the way home. &nbsp;Tim and Bill Koch came over for dinner.

23</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Woke up with a bad cold. &nbsp;Unemployment office at 1PM to meet with Ben. &nbsp;The late afternoon light was gorgeous and the sun was out, lovely. &nbsp;Ben was on top of the blockchain scene which made my conversation with him very comfortable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 24</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nice talk with Lee Miller. &nbsp;He wanted us to come down to Earth Rising on Sunday for a pot luck, but since I have a cold I am going to pass this time. &nbsp;I told him about our party but he has something

to the Indian restaurant next door. &nbsp;My first time there was with Ted Z several months back. &nbsp;The meal today wasn&#39;t great, but wasn&#39;t shitty either. &nbsp;I got on the bus and rode home. &nbsp;In the late afternoon I cleaned out the garage, got rid of a bunch of boxes that were housing our winter squash in preparation for the party next week and talked to Patrick and Izzy till dark.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 03</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Walk around the park and back early in the morning. &nbsp;Hb went to Eugene for a massage and I stayed

weekend. &nbsp;Hb also bought some Cognac. &nbsp;Both versions were Patron. &nbsp;From there we hit the Farmer&#39;s market where I bought a bunch of sunchokes and potatoe starts from Luke who was out on an errand. &nbsp;From there we went to an estate sale and we saw Naj and Phoenix who invited us to their house tomorrow evening for a Pizza potluck. &nbsp;I bought a post hole / wood splitter for $2.50. &nbsp;From there TJ&#39;s and then I walked down 10th to Harrison as Hb shopped in VC. &nbsp;Got home and went for a big walk around the park and down to Renee&#39;s. &nbsp;Hb lost her orange hat along the way and we found it sitting on Miriam&#39;s mailbox on the way home. &nbsp;We sent Miriam a text message and told her she did her &quot;mitzvah&quot; for the day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 05</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mellow day at home followed by a very nice pizza dinner at Naj and Phoenix&#39;s house. &nbsp;Terrie, Holly, Renee, Johng, and Tim were there too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 06</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jan and Boyd got a new wood floor put in their living room so we went over to their house to see it. &nbsp;We stayed for 2 hours and had tea. &nbsp;Afterwards we went for a long walk around the park and stopped and picked up Hb&#39;s umbrella at Renee&#39;s tent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 07</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Went out to buy a screen door compression closer, went all over town and ended up getting it at Robnett&#39;s. &nbsp;In

tomorrow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 08</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Walk late in the evening around 8:30PM. &nbsp;I did my classic late evening walk to the end of Bethel where the side walk ends. &nbsp;I love doing that at night, especially when I didn&#39;t get a walk in that day. &nbsp;The rains let up for my walk, a blessing as always.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 09</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Annual Sustainability Coalition meeting at OSU.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 10</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First sunny day since back from Chico. &nbsp;Long walk to the park. &nbsp;Saw Karen Mayo who just got back from a 2 month trip to Mx. &nbsp;Over to the COOP, bank for Hb bday cash and the library to drop off a box of books that has been sitting in the garage for a year or more that I bought at the library book sale years back. &nbsp;Now I just buy books I want to read. &nbsp;At that time I was buying bags of books for five dollars. &nbsp;Came home and prepared the west garden for spring planting in the upcoming days. &nbsp;Will put in some fava beans and more sun chokes. &nbsp;Also, I have been planting grass in the cave which appears to be taking pretty well. &nbsp;At the end of the day I sat down on my chair in front of the garage door and dreamed again of warmer days when I can sit there at the end of the day and read. &nbsp;Today I was reading Charles Dickens Bleak House which I aquired earlier in the day at the library Friends Book room classic section. &nbsp;After visiting London last year for the first time, I love reading about London in the time of Dickens and what it was like to alive then in such a vibrant city of despair and luxury.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 11</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farmer&#39;s Market early. &nbsp;Attending our party was Bob, Heidi, Doug, Jamie, Boyd, Jan,

lightbulb at Safeway and drop off some trash and buy some gas. &nbsp;The afternoon was beautiful and we did a bunch of gardening including planting fava beans and sunchokes. &nbsp;I also started on the east leave garden with boxes and some chokes and lots of potatoe starts I bought from Luke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 13</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finished up my taxes and filed them and then got an amended return notification message from vgd an hour later. &nbsp;Oh brother, luckily it was only a 3 dollar difference. &nbsp;Went to get some new gas for the mower and then Hb and I went for a walk down to the river. &nbsp;Afterwards I mixed Patrick an ant toxic for his ant problem as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 14</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since its going to rain this afternoon we worked outside in the morning and got the lawn mower started. &nbsp;Then we went for a walk around the park. &nbsp;It did indeed rain the rest of the day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 15</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We got a walk in today despite it being very rainy. &nbsp;We walked over to WL around 5PM and coming back through the park we saw Steve finishing up a round of disc golf. &nbsp;Earlier in the day I spoke to Dad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 16</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A sunny day. &nbsp;Worked outside in the early afternoon. &nbsp;At 4PM we did the third Thursday Art Walk. &nbsp;Beatrice had the best food as always. &nbsp;The sun and the late winter day struck us with good vibes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 17</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Worked all day. &nbsp;In the evening we went to the UU to hear Cassandra a local singer from Corvallis and Libby a native Alaskan political activist for the Spring Creek project. &nbsp;We sat next to Ken and hung out with Wil and Kathy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 18</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gathering Together Farm for breakfast around 11AM. &nbsp;Ali took care of us, we finally learned her name. &nbsp;Her name is pronounced like Ali McGraw and or the word alley. &nbsp;It was cold in there and we sat on the 2nd level. &nbsp;We went home afterwards and went for a short walk around the block. &nbsp;In the evening we went to Kathy Miller&#39;s house for a lovely dinner with Wil and Brenda who came late and brought a lovely dessert. &nbsp;She told us about her adventures as a young girl and moving out to Oregon in a church bus she bought for $450.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 19</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Worked outside all day. &nbsp;From about 11AM to dark. &nbsp;I planted the remaining sunchokes in the east garden strip, Naj and Phoenix stopped by for awhile, Patrick drove by and I chatted with him, Heidi came over and we talked for awhile, and Hb was in and out with her journey class and potluck hours exchange. &nbsp;The other main things I did was cut the grass, and dig up the grass surrounding the garlic bed with the fig tree. &nbsp;A gorgeous sunny warm day was had by all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 20</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mailed off Sarah paperwork for Arcadian Trail and stopped by the bank, gas, and TJ&#39;s as I did my swing through Corvallis. &nbsp;In the evening we went to the Hilton Garden Inn for an investment seminar and a free dinner. &nbsp;We had a fun table with a Vietnamese lady sitting next to us and some folks from Glendive who bought a 2003 Corvette.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 21</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Spoke to the folks from Ownage for the first time. &nbsp;Hb and I went for a walk in the afternoon, caught some real good sun briefly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 22</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Up early, picked up Pedro at 9AM, back home by 10:30AM. &nbsp;Beautiful morning as it was sunny driving to the airport and a bit more cloudy driving back on Peoria road. &nbsp;In the early afternoon I had a long talk with Iris, post speaking to Jack du Rose. &nbsp;Late in the afternoon Hb and I cut the grass, went for a short walk, Patrick planted some oregano for us and we went to hear </span><span

23</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another round of talks with Dotun from Ownage, this time it was the technical interview which started out rocky but I passed it. &nbsp;Afterwards I walked over to Country Club and 49th and literally ran onto the bus. &nbsp;I walked / ran up to the stop and got on the bus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 24</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Spoke to Jeff Mankoff and heard from Berk. &nbsp;Got my walk in at mid day around the park. &nbsp;There was some sun and clouds and I was happy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span

went to the horse show in Albany.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 26</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It rained all day here. &nbsp;We managed to get out for a short walk around 6PM. &nbsp;Long talk with Michael Berkowitz. &nbsp;We had not spoke since we were staying in Ashland about 18 months ago. &nbsp;Also spoke to Pedro and did some short work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 27</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Up at 6AM to check in to Southwest. &nbsp;Left the house and shot up I5 for a stop in the area of Multnomah village. &nbsp;Hb&#39;s store was closed so we headed over to Council Crest Park. &nbsp;You get a great view of the city from here along with a view out to the west towards Beaverton. &nbsp;Portland is a cool city. &nbsp;From there we dropped down and had a Vietnamese lunch at our old stomping grounds lunch spot called Thanh Long. &nbsp;The food was good but not great, so we might not be going back there for awhile. &nbsp;After lunch we headed over to the Albert street hood, walked around a bit and then stopped by Season&#39;s for some dinner stuff for later. &nbsp;Got to our hotel, checked in and I went for a walk in the industrial section of the airport. &nbsp;The energy here isn&#39;t great, but it was a nice evening and I got to see the Radisson which is pricey.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 28</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Up at 2AM and showed myself that having confidence in yourself and you can make almost anything in reason happen. &nbsp;Hb got up at 3AM and we were on the 4AM shuttle to the airport. &nbsp;Flew through Denver and arrived Nashville around 2:30PM and Wayne picked us up and gave us our first tour of downtown Nashville. &nbsp;He had lived in Edmondton, Canada for 7 years but was from Nashville. &nbsp;His Mom died recently and he inherited the house and was telling us how Nashville was growing so fast along with the building. &nbsp;Scarritt Bennett Center is very nice. &nbsp;We met Doris Stewart who is lovely. &nbsp;Hb became quick friends with her and hopefully we will go to church with her next Sunday. &nbsp;In the evening after a nice dinner at Chipotle we went to a Believer&#39;s ceremony and met Mary who turned us on to her daughter&#39;s prayer and music service. &nbsp;It was impressive, very impressive some believers were healed and the keyboard and guitar player along with the passion of the people there blew me out of the water. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think I had every in my life witnessed and understood the bible belt as much as I did tonight. &nbsp;It was truly a memorable experience and something I will never forget. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 29</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our first full day in Nashville was gorgeous. &nbsp;We started out the day with breakfast at Biscuit Love. &nbsp;From there we ventured around the hood and then under the tracks over to the Music city Convention Center and then on to the fancy hotel in town where we saw E&#39;s favorite shop called Hatch Show Print. &nbsp;The hotel in which the shop sits was having a convention and so we got free candy and pop corn. &nbsp;From there we walked across the pedestrian bridge and through the heart of down town. &nbsp;Nashville is impressive. &nbsp;We ended up the day at Hattie B&#39;s home fried chicken. &nbsp;We chatted with Doris Stewart and HG Stovall who were very friendly and turned me on to using the library. &nbsp;The people in Nashville are very friendly. &nbsp;I told Peter that Nashville was impressive and almost as impressive as London. &nbsp;That might have been a stretch, but not really.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 30</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Walk over to the Parthenon, lunch at Thai restaurant nearby then ice cream at Ben and Jerry&#39;s. &nbsp;From there we walked downtown to our natural grocery store to buy some food for breakfast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 31</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Walked Hb over to the Parthenon then caught the bus downtown. &nbsp;From there I took the 55 bus south of town, walked around a bit and then came back to downtown. &nbsp;From there I had a nice Cobb salad and walked home. &nbsp;In the evening we went to have mexican food which a new friend Michele made at the workshop who lives in Liberty, Utah.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">April</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 01</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hb went to the Bill Henry workshop and I worked in the morning. &nbsp;Around noon I walked over to the Edgehill Festival and checked out the Italian restaurant that Hb liked for dinner. &nbsp;Then I walked downtown to eat at salad at the Turnip Truck and walked back home. &nbsp;Hb and I went to have dinner at the Italian restaurant. &nbsp;It was a nice chilly sunny day in Nashville.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 02</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Work till noon, then walk over to Bellcourt Taps, the bar south of Scarritt Bennett. &nbsp;Had a nice lunch at the Grilled Cheese place then walked further south and had 2 free ribs at Kroger where I bought some bananas. &nbsp;From there walked east and then south till I ran into a Thai market and restaurant where I got some fried rice and a piece of rice cake. &nbsp;And here I am back in my room around 3:30PM on a gorgeous sunny day in Nashville. &nbsp;This place makes me feel good being in the south on a nice campus kind of feels a bit like Caltech and my office there. &nbsp;That place felt pretty good as well. &nbsp;Having a comfortable office is important. &nbsp;Music tonight was great at Bellcourt Taps with </span><span class="c4 c2"><a class="c5"

met on the plane from Portland. &nbsp;It was a nice venue, not too loud, and we enjoyed the different musicians up on the stage. &nbsp;I gave the bar waiter a $10 tip and he was real happy, so a good time was had by all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 03</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We went to the Frist and saw the Buddhist exhibit. &nbsp;We spent some time hanging out with Michael Lennon from Boulder who also lives in the Keys. &nbsp;He attended the workshop this weekend with Hb and William Henry. &nbsp;Afterwards we stopped by the big Union Station next to the library which used to be the post office and the train station is now a hotel. &nbsp;Then on to big up our rental car followed by lunch at the Turnip Truck, we love their salads.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At dusk I took a walk around Vanderbuilt to the south back towards where we were hanging out last night.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 04</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Up at 1:30AM and did some meditation. &nbsp;We officially got up around 5AM. &nbsp;We left around 6AM and had a nice breakfast at Wild Eggs in Bowling Green, Kentucky. &nbsp;You know its a good place when they have gluten free bread. &nbsp;It was excellent. &nbsp;From there we headed to Mammoth Cave National Park. &nbsp;It was my first time ever in a cave. &nbsp;They had a self guided tour because all of the other tours were booked. &nbsp;Being in this long, huge cave was amazing. &nbsp;Afterwards we ate some lunch and then went for a big hike &nbsp;along the green river. &nbsp;It was a super fantastic day, we met some nice people who steered us down the road to a diner in Pig, Kentucky where we had some BBQ, and 3 sides, of white beans, mashed potatoes and cole slaw with peanut butter pie for dessert. &nbsp;We headed back into the park and hiked down into a sink hole called Cedar Sink Trail. &nbsp;This was a magical part of the park. &nbsp;Just before dusk we started heading home and was back at SBC at dark, literally. &nbsp;It was just dark. &nbsp;So the day was perfect. &nbsp;We took in our things and then went for a short walk in the warm spring evening in Nashville. &nbsp;It was still, calm and lovely. &nbsp;A good day was had by all. &nbsp;We are alive and well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 05</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whole Foods for breakfast with Hb, then went for a walk in the neighborhood just south of there. &nbsp;We parked at a park and then walked around. &nbsp;Came home and did laundry. &nbsp;I had a long talk with Peter and talked to him from the building where I was doing the laundry. &nbsp;Then we went to have a late lunch at the Turnip truck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 06</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We went out to lunch on 12th South at a place called </span><span class="c4 c2"><a class="c5"

happy. &nbsp;Afterwards we headed over to Dilliards in the same shopping area as Whole Foods where we went yesterday. &nbsp;Upon coming home we headed over to Vanderbilt to try and find the band Maybe April who was playing somewhere on campus, but a wild goose chase through the basement of Medical Center North and then over to Children&#39;s Hospital followed by a trek to the Common&#39;s yieled no results. &nbsp;Maybe April will not be, unfortunately visited by us this trip. &nbsp;The evening turned warmer with blue sky and some sun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 07</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Breakfast at Vanderbilt south of here. &nbsp;Kids and parents who had gotten into Vandy were there. &nbsp;Out to Andrew Jackson&#39;s house called the Hermitage. &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c2"><a class="c5"

class="c2">&nbsp;both spoke eloquently about Jackson and his presidency. &nbsp;No one glossed over his good and bad points. &nbsp;The place is amazing. &nbsp;And Hb and I sat in the tall switch out on the 1200 acre plot and relished in her glory on a gorgeous sun soaked Friday afternoon in early April and said to each other it doesn&#39;t get any better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 08</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Drove down to Franklin after a nice breakfast at Whole Foods. &nbsp;We walked around downtown Franklin, ate some ice cream, and went for a walk and met some folks who took us into their home to show us what a home looks like on the National Historic Register. &nbsp;Afterwards we went out to the </span><span class="c4 c2"><a class="c5"

Parkway</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and went for a hike. &nbsp;This is an interesting place, and we were surprised by its beauty. &nbsp;Thai dinner on the corner of Edge Hill and 12th, yummy. &nbsp;Aferwards we walked along Vanderbilt, the places we had not been yet. &nbsp;Its a nice campus. &nbsp;8000 soldiers died in Franklin in 2 days during the Civil war.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 09</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Doris Stewart&#39;s church where we had a nice breakfast of chicken and eggs. &nbsp;The service was wonderful, the black people were the nicest people I had ever met in a group of prayers. &nbsp;Afterwards we went home and then walked downtown for lunch at the Turnip Truck. &nbsp;In the evening we went to a vespers service and it was our first time in the chapel at Scarritt Bennett Center. &nbsp;The evening was gorgeous, warm and the light at the end of the day over Nashville was magical and spiritual for this Palm Sunday where Jesus was in our lives from beginning to end. &nbsp;It was the first time we had ever gone to two Palm Sunday services in our lives.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 10</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Early in the morning I took the car back to Enterprise and walked home. &nbsp;Hb and I went to eat breakfast at our new favorite spot at the Vandy cafeteria. &nbsp;Came back and delivered Doris Stewart some extra peanuts we had left over. &nbsp;In the afternoon we went over to the shops on 21st and had a lunch at the same place Hb got her hamburger last week and I got the large house salad and veggie burger. &nbsp;From there we walked over to the Thai Market and I got for a 2nd time my rice cake and some friend rice for $4.92. &nbsp;We checked out Belmont University and then walked home. &nbsp;I started packing for a trip home tomorrow. &nbsp;The weather today was absolutely gorgeous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 11</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Up at 6AM, breakfast at our Vandy spot, said goodbye to Doris Stewart and Wayne picked us up at 9AM and told us his story about a UFO experience. &nbsp;They are out there. &nbsp;Sitting in the airport having fun waiting for the flight back home. &nbsp;I had a great talk with a man who is neighbors with Neil Gorsuch and owns a 100 acre horse farm on the edge of Boulder. &nbsp;It was one of those awesome conversations that you get every once in a while on an airplane. &nbsp;Today I hit the big home run. &nbsp;We talked the gamut, cancer, nutrition, cattle, Whole Foods, conservation easements. &nbsp;He and I were about the same age.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 12</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bank, shopping, mail, sent Sarah the dates for the Arcadian Trail contract. &nbsp;Never left the house for the rest of the day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 13</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hb went to work at the cemetery and I stayed home and worked. &nbsp;At the end of the day I walked over to Mark&#39;s house and back and then had a nice long talk with Patrick and Mindy. &nbsp;Its good to be back home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 14</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Up early, its spring time here in Oregon and that means a lot more light. &nbsp;So I am getting up early which I love, its all about this time of year and the spring / summer cycle. &nbsp;Being back from a two week journey to Nashville I am back in the swing of my life here at home, and dealing with myself and my life. &nbsp;In the afternoon, I went to get gas for the lawn mower. &nbsp;Hb and I cut the grass, it was crazy out of control as it had not been cut since probably almost a week before we left for Nashville and this time of year the grass grows super fast. &nbsp;So getting that done was a big deal. &nbsp;In the evening we went to hear the live Kirtan band. &nbsp;Kitzy was back in swing, and afterwards she told me her story of her back surgery and how lucky she was to have had a good operation. &nbsp;Linda Edwards was there as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 15</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First farmer&#39;s market of the year was sunny and slightly warm. &nbsp;Talked to Luke for awhile. &nbsp;Lunch at Gathering followed by a nice hike out to the Harris covered bridge. &nbsp;It was our first time driving down that road and the fact it goes through Wren and under the highway was confusing. &nbsp;Upon getting home I did some yard work and Hb and Patrick had a cocktail. &nbsp;It was a gorgeous sunny spring day in Corvallis, just the way I like it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 16</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Peter came over for Easter dinner at 2:30PM and afterwards we watched a movie called Buck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 17</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Caught the 9:30AM bus and got off at Western, walked to the Vitamin Cottage and bought some dates. &nbsp;Then back into town and ran into Hezekiah on 5th and B streets where he showed me around his amazing music studio. &nbsp;Then on to the COOP where I ate an early lunch, hung out with Strix / Ron and then had a long talk with Craig from EarthRising. &nbsp;He lived initially at Earth Rising in the late 70&#39;s, left for 20 years, and came back in 1999. Got home around 2:30PM. &nbsp;It was a cloudy wet day, but my whole adventure was without getting rained on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 18</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Walk in the mid afternoon prior to Hb arriving back from Eugene. &nbsp;Oddfellows in the evening for the business meeting. &nbsp;We do not want to go to these very often. &nbsp;It was our first tme seeing Phoenix as the Nobel Grand. &nbsp;Lee is gone, he headed off to France after his tenure was over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 19</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So because the weather is rainy I am going for walks in the morning when its not raining. &nbsp;Today I did the exact same walk as Monday, buying one item at the VC and walking back to the library where I saw Kerry and Diane and then walked home and got home at 1PM, having caught the 10:30AM bus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 20</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dan and Amy&#39;s for shiva with Rabbit Benjamin per Amy&#39;s father who passed last week. &nbsp;Tal and Miriam and Jim were there so we had a nice talk with them.</span></p><p

grass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 23</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our annual Thyme Garden with Ken, last year we missed cause we were in England but the year before

it was chilly and not much sun. &nbsp;A good time was had by all. &nbsp;We met Janet the owner of the farm and Emily her daughter who is next to Luke at the Farmer&#39;s Market.</span></p><p

the manager at the New World Deli. &nbsp;The evening was crisp, but the blue sky and clouds dominated the late spring light and summer closeness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday

&nbsp;In the evening I spoke to Natalie the little girl who lives in the Spanish house along with her Mom. &nbsp;She has five kids and the oldest is 20. &nbsp;Afterwards I had a long talk with Mindy. &nbsp;Patrick was away installing the wood stove in Halfway. &nbsp;Mindy was relaxed and hanging out side. &nbsp;It will probably be one of our final talks prior to her moving away to Halfway. &nbsp;Having them as neighbors has been marvelous. &nbsp;We are going to miss them, but they are on their journey and that means going out to Halfway in a more rural setting. &nbsp;Its what Patrick wants to do, and Mindy is up for the adventure. &nbsp;Cooper is going to live with his father in Bend.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 24</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We saw Sawyer riding his bike downtown and spoke with him for awhile. &nbsp;We saw Kerry and Diane riding their bikes home. &nbsp;I met Joseph from Tye Dye Farm and Jeff Broadie from Lonesome Whistle

Phoenix came over in the morning and we hung out for awhile on the side lawn. &nbsp;In fact he helped us define the side lawn spot and make use of it more going forward. &nbsp;We tried it out on Pedro one hour later and then Hb came home from her hair appointment and we all like the new spot. &nbsp;Afterwards Hb cut my hair and then I watered the lovely corn that is growing nicely. &nbsp;In the late afternoon we walked down to the park and sat on the bench. &nbsp;Hb and I are doing well, we are finally moving forward from our inner childs and recognizing where we are at, and getting along like adults on a more consistent basis. &nbsp;Summer is in full gear, enjoy it !</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 30</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Swung by the COOP to buy some food for tonight&#39;s dinner with Phoenix and Naj. &nbsp;They came over at 5:30PM and we had fried chicken with polenta, greens and beans. &nbsp;In the evening Hb went over to Xigam land for a fire with Leon and the Camas ritual. &nbsp;It was a chilly night and I stayed home and chilled out for awhile. &nbsp;Can&#39;t believe we are at the end of Part I of the 2017 diary, but we are.

&nbsp;In the afternoon we took a nap and then went for a hike in Chip Ross Park around 6PM. &nbsp;Afterwards we went to TJ&#39;s for our party tomorrow at Scott Stursa&#39;s. &nbsp;It was a beautiful evening and the hike in the forest was perfect. &nbsp;Last night was chilly and windy, for the fire circle at Renee&#39;s which I skipped and Hb attended. &nbsp;Down on the land it was still, but up at our house it was darn right a cold summer night. &nbsp;Phoenix and Naj came over last evening and we had a very nice evening having them over for dinner at 5PM. &nbsp;We saw Tim at the Farmer&#39;s Market and spoke to him for awhile. &nbsp;He is doing well and was also down in Florence at the Odd Fellows camping spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 02</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Spoke to M &amp; D in the morning. &nbsp;I have been speaking to them on Sunday morning and it has been working out well. &nbsp;Having a regular time in my mind when I speak to them makes it work, and makes me remember when to call them which is important. &nbsp;We went over to Scott and Kathy&#39;s house, Scott is the author of the book &quot;Distilled in Oregon&quot;. &nbsp;It was our first time to their house in a party setting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 03</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Really nice walk in the park in

class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 08</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farmer&#39;s Market at noon, followed by Gathering Together. &nbsp;Ali was our waitress, and hopefully we can remember her name. &nbsp;We stopped by Naj and Phoenix&#39;s house looking for Hb&#39;s hat, but then we came home and Hb remembered it was in my extra black backpack. &nbsp;Harvest garlic in the evening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 09</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Up early and was outside by 8AM. &nbsp;Completed the garlic harvest in the hot sun and finished by 11:30AM. &nbsp;Pedro came over from his bike ride and we hung out till about 2PM. &nbsp;Then I went over to Chipotle Mexian grill. &nbsp;It was my first time eating there in Corvallis and it was yummy. &nbsp;I sat outside in the hot sun and ate as the inside music and AC was too much for me. &nbsp;Hb was at her class with Lawrence. &nbsp;Came home and did a bunch of gardening including cleaning up the wood pile mess in the wetlands. &nbsp;This time of year you can get in the there and its nice and dry. &nbsp;I stacked up some old wood, got ride of some blackberries, and got rid of some minimal trash. &nbsp;Then cleaned up some black berries in other parts of the side yard including the cave. &nbsp;I was outside from 8AM till 6PM. &nbsp;It was one of my longest days outside this summer. &nbsp;Its 85 degrees right now at 7PM.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 10</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Comcast guy Michael (</span><span class="c12">541 393

cloudy morning and fairly sunny afternoon. &nbsp;My first day without Hb was sad but I am enjoying the peace and quiet in a strange way. &nbsp;Hb is the most important thing in my life by far. &nbsp;Everything else is really just details. &nbsp;At 6PM I went to the art opening at OSU. &nbsp;It was the community event. &nbsp;Beatrice was there with her daughter and grandaughter whose birthday is October 25. &nbsp;I sat with an artist who lives at the Menonite Village in Albany and her friend from there as well. &nbsp;She started painting at age 81 and she is 84. &nbsp;An inspiration to us all, and especially me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 14</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First early morning run in a long time. &nbsp;Came home and did a massive watering of the front yard. &nbsp;Its going to be 85 today. &nbsp;The weather this summer has been gorgeous. &nbsp;I had a talk with Bob about his truck. &nbsp;Pedro called as well about his modem issue. &nbsp;Also he and I spoke earlier in the week. &nbsp;Doug in Silver City is NOT going to buy the farm. &nbsp;He finalized that decision this week in a call to Peter. &nbsp;Last month Pedro had sent him an email regarding the farm and Martha had gotten back to Peter. &nbsp;But now its sealed, Pedro will probably end up selling the farm land to one of the neighbors. &nbsp;In the evening I went to Kirtan, the band played. &nbsp;It was one of my most moving Kirtans ever. &nbsp;Sid Rosen will no longer play in the band. &nbsp;He is moving on in his life after six years. &nbsp;Hb spent the night in Boise at our friend&#39;s house Rita. &nbsp;Sounds like she had a great time. &nbsp;Boise is booming like Nashville. &nbsp;The US economy is clearly on a local upward path. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 15</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the fairgrounds by 8AM for the Kinetic Sculpture Race. &nbsp;Bonnie and I collected money and parked cars till noon. &nbsp;Then I went to the bank, Farmer&#39;s Market (briefly) and on to TJ&#39;s to buy a bunch of food. &nbsp;Hung out for the rest of the day. &nbsp;Hb arrived in Liberty, Utah at her friend Diane&#39;s house safe and sound.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 16</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Internet blow out last night. &nbsp;Came back on late this evening. &nbsp;I went to the Kinetic Sculpture Race down at the dock and then walked through the park. &nbsp;Back at 2:30PM, Ken came over at 3PM. &nbsp;Peter picked us up at 4PM and we went out to Tim and Raina&#39;s for the potluck. &nbsp;It was the first time at their house. &nbsp;It was lovely, majical, spiritual, uplifting. &nbsp;Afterwards Boyd and Jan had their potluck for Mindy&#39;s 40th Birthday. &nbsp;I got their after they left, but hung out with Bob, Heidi, Doug, Jaime, Steve, Jan and Boyd. &nbsp;At Blue Rock I sat next to Steve Rose and Harry sat across from us in the sun room. &nbsp;Unfortunately, Naj did not make it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 17</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Great drive down to Monroe on Hwy99. &nbsp;Cut off at Orchard, Coon Road and circled back to the Earth Rising driveway then on to Steve Rose&#39;s house where I picked up &quot;my plant&quot; that I was going to get at Earth Rising earlier in the summer. &nbsp;Steve also gave me some mushrooms which I will attempt to start growing in the back yard. &nbsp;Came home and went to get some wood chips over at Coho and then went to get air in my tires and stopped by the COOP to get some Tamari. &nbsp;Steve Rose&#39;s wife Beatrice bought the land back in the 70&#39;s and Steve moved in in the 90&#39;s. &nbsp;In the late afternoon I planted the plant I got from Steve and in mid evening went for a walk around the block. &nbsp;I saw Celia. &nbsp;She is done with working at the restaurant. &nbsp;She told me the story, they basically hired &quot;younger&quot; meseras and they wanted her to cook and do dishes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 18</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Power blow out at about 9PM so I went to bed at that time. &nbsp;Earlier in the day Mindy and I went for a walk around the park in celebration of her 40th birthday. &nbsp;In the evening I went to the Tuesday market and talked to Sawyer, I bought the spinner from him for $11. &nbsp;Also spoke to Valerie whom I bought 3 cookies from. &nbsp;Sole whom I bought blueberries from, and Cat o Gata who came down from Albany to sell her vegetables. &nbsp;She knows Spanish pretty well and has immersed herself in Spanish here in Oregon, a testament to what you can do as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 19</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the late afternoon I took the bus over to OSU. &nbsp;Walked over to Circle and Kings and took the bus back home to &quot;Goodpark&quot;. &nbsp;That is my new favorite place to get off the bus. &nbsp;I spoke to Pedro in the morning for about one hour and in the evening for 2.5 hours on the phone. &nbsp;My phone is up and running as Hb was driving from Liberty, Utah to Laramie, Wyoming. &nbsp;She arrived safe and sound in Laramie and spent the night at the Days Inn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 20</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hb arrives in Denver at Luke&#39;s around 11AM after spending the night in Laramie last evening. &nbsp;Prior she was in Belknap Hot Springs, Boise with Rita, and Liberty, Utah with Diane. &nbsp;She left one week ago today. &nbsp;I nailed down my plans with Martin for Saturday. &nbsp;In the evening walked across the field where Bell ends towards 99. &nbsp;Its a nice walk out in that field, but the Hwy is pretty noisy. &nbsp;It was my first time ever doing that; the whole thing for sure. &nbsp;It butts up against Luke&#39;s farm way at the other end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 21</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Run in the morning followed by watering. &nbsp;In the evening I hung out with Ken, Gail, and her son Michael at the Sr. Center for their summer BBQ. &nbsp;Kerry and Diane were working there. &nbsp;It was a beautiful summer evening. &nbsp;Perfect weather, and the light is just starting to wane a bit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span

and Bruce. &nbsp;Bruce and I talked about nuclear energy this time and it was very interesting. &nbsp;He was into nuclear energy at Reed College but afterwards decided that it was not fair for humans to create this mess and leave it to future generations of living species for millions of years and so now he is vehemently opposed to it. &nbsp;He mentioned a company in Corvallis called </span><span

our annual Philomath Studio Tour. &nbsp;It was his birthday so we had chocolate cake, Dale turned 74 today. &nbsp;Afterwards at 2PM we went to the library to hear an excellent talk on Big Foot by

class="c1">, it was superb. &nbsp;Afterwards we stopped by Block 15 and Hb had a burger and fries. &nbsp;At home, we went for a short walk around the block. &nbsp;Leonard was selling his apples for 50 cents a pound. &nbsp;We have apples or I would have been in to buy some. &nbsp;The autumn leaves are in full peak, especially around the library area.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 23</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Out to Greengables to buy our annual winter squash haul. &nbsp;This year we only got about 20 bucks worth of squash which was 64 pounds. &nbsp;Aftewards we had lunch at the Thai place out there. &nbsp;Hb doesn&#39;t like the Pad Thai but I did. &nbsp;The lunch special was $9.95 plus a buck for rice. &nbsp;In the late afternoon I got my first haul of leaves and went for a short walk around the block.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 24</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Went over to JohnG&#39;s at 4:30PM, I helped him download Firefox and Chrome and then we went for a walk around the block past Dave and Anna&#39;s house. &nbsp;HayDuke was inside. &nbsp;Then over to the Tuesday market. &nbsp;It was a glorious day in Oregon; and the Tuesday market was just as perfect. &nbsp;At dark Mark and I walked home after we sat around the fire for the 2nd Tuesday in a row with Renee and Kathy and Cheryl.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 25</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Started collecting leaves at around 2PM. &nbsp;Worked till dark on different things. &nbsp;My neighbor Ken on Bell lent me his big trailer with wheels on it. &nbsp;I raked his leaves and got leaves at the end of the street next to the big barking dog. &nbsp;Afterwards I cut the grass, drained the hoses and enjoyed the autumn day accordingly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 26</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hb and I walk over to Avery Park and around the river loop. &nbsp;Its been awhile since we did that. &nbsp;Then we stopped by the COOP and we walked downtown and I hit the bank. &nbsp;Then we took the bus home and I hit the mother lode in leaves. &nbsp;I filled in the upper side garden. &nbsp;The lower side garden had leaves in it from last year and with this big load of leaves I decided to fill in the upper part. &nbsp;The leaves were at the end of Mason, and make a left on Thompson. &nbsp;I worked outside till about 8:30PM. &nbsp;The moon was out and most of the time I only had on 2 T-shirts. &nbsp;Around the last load I put on my sweat shirt. &nbsp;I love hauling leaves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 27</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Spoke to Dad in the morning. &nbsp;Jan and Boyd arrived home today from a month long journey. &nbsp;Hb and I went to lunch at the Indian restaurant downtown. &nbsp;It was my first time eating there, but Hb and I had been there in the past but I did not eat. &nbsp;It was good and better than the other restaurant in town. &nbsp;I walked over to the bank on campus and then home through Avery Park. &nbsp;I saw Luke at the Mexican grocery in southtown and then he gave me a ride back to his place. &nbsp;I walked home from there and did the gutters. &nbsp;Another gorgeous day in OR. &nbsp;Shorts and a T-shirt was all I needed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 28</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pedro showed up around noon and we sat outside for hours. &nbsp;It was a perfect warm day in OR. &nbsp;After Peter left Doug, our neighbor showed up for awhile. &nbsp;He is going to Thailand in 2 weeks. &nbsp;We went to Marvin and Margaret&#39;s Figley Up party for the first time this evening. &nbsp;It was a beautiful party with super duper energy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 29</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hb went to the Lawrence journey group with Anya and I went to the Philomath studio tour.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 30</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hit the 2nd mother lode of leaves in front of Curt&#39;s house. &nbsp;Hb had her first chiropractor appt with Don Peterson. &nbsp;Angelica came over in the evening to pick up her coloidal silver.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 31</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hb was going to Oddfellows and she dropped me off downtown for Trick or treat downtown. &nbsp;Then I walked over to King&#39;s caught the bus and went home. &nbsp;I talked to the bus driver downtown and she started driving the bus in her late 20&#39;s in the late 80&#39;s. &nbsp;Hb took off for Oddfellows and I went to the Tuesday market. &nbsp;It was a great evening with Atole from Francesca and hot cider from Michael and Cheryl. &nbsp;Then Coho for cookies and cider then over to Mark&#39;s house to hang and see some treaters as well. &nbsp;It was a gorgeous day and the night was very chilly on my walk home. &nbsp;I love living in OR especially in our hood of southtown. &nbsp;We are now off to Ashland.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8

&nbsp;Mamosa&#39;s in Grants Pass by 1PM. &nbsp;We took I5 into Ashland instead of going the back way this time. &nbsp;We got into our place around 3:30PM then headed over to the COOP for some stuff. &nbsp;Short walk into town and that was the day. &nbsp;In the evening I had a nice talk with Mom who had called us last night.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 02</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Walked into town the back way just east of our house. &nbsp;We had never walked that way before, but it was nice. &nbsp;After lunch at the COOP we walked around town a bit and then into Lithia Park. &nbsp;The leaves were past their peak but still gorgeous. &nbsp;The day was chilly but not cold. &nbsp;Autumn in Ashland is lovely and Hb and I are real happy, fortunate, appreciative and blessed to be back here again. &nbsp;In the evening we went to a book reading at the local book store. &nbsp;The lady, author was nice but the talk was not very good. &nbsp;We left just prior to her finishing up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 03</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a rainy day in the morning but by afternoon it was starting to clear a bit. &nbsp;Hb and I went into Medford. &nbsp;We got some gas along the way then on to TJ&#39;s and the TMobile store to renew my 90 day license. &nbsp;Then from there we had a fantastic lunch at los tres Potrillos in Phoenix. &nbsp;Potrillos means baby horse or foal. &nbsp;The food was incredible, it was authentic mexican food and they made their own tortillos. &nbsp;I was in tortillo heaven. &nbsp;In the evening we went to the 1st Friday art walk and landed at a gallery where we heard Grant Ruiz and Dan Fellman. &nbsp;That motivated our trip tomorrow to the winery to check out where they will be playing next Saturday night. &nbsp;Hb picked up a CD from them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 04</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Went to the </span><span class="c4

class="c1">&nbsp;winery for a nice lunch. &nbsp;Then did a very cool hike from there on the side of a massive hillside with tons of oak trees and lots of mud. &nbsp;It was a great day there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 05</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hb and I went to church in the morning at the UU, it was our first time there. &nbsp;Afterwards we went to the COOP to pick up some salmon for dinner. &nbsp;It was kind of a rainy day so we stayed in the rest of the day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 06</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Left the house at noon to a room filled with sun after a cloudy morning. &nbsp;We walked till 1pm and then hit a Dream workshop from 1 - 2PM at the Washington Federal Bank Building with the coffee shop inside it and the community room. &nbsp;Afterwards we went to the COOP for lunch. &nbsp;Then we went to the library for awhile and read. &nbsp;At around 4PM we walked up Gresham to the very top of the hill. &nbsp;Then did our loop back through the park. &nbsp;It was a beautiful sunny day, slightly warm and perfect Ashland autumn weather.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 07</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Walk with Hb down Laurel to the freeway then swing back around on Oak. &nbsp;We saw the llamas at the end of the road and sat by the creek. &nbsp;Stopped by the COOP briefly to get a few items then headed on home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 08</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right after breakfast we headed up towards the PCT. &nbsp;It was a brisk wind, but slightly warm and cloudy sort of. &nbsp;We first did the Tubs OR State Park. &nbsp;Then we hit the Greensprings Restaurant which turned out to be a very interesting experience because we met a young woman who knew Kaypatcha. &nbsp;It was the first person Hb had met who knew him personally. &nbsp;She had lived in Costa Rica in the town of Punta Mona. &nbsp;Afterwards we hiked the north side of Hwy 66 on the PCT. &nbsp;Last time we did the south side. &nbsp;There was snow on the trail but it was beautiful. &nbsp;We got home around 3PM and did a nice meal here at home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 09</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hb goes downtown to hang out for awhile. &nbsp;We go to lunch at the Indian restaurant and I don&#39;t eat anything. &nbsp;I come back home and then we go for a walk through the park. &nbsp;We discover a Chinese lady picking Gingko berries which inside house a nut. &nbsp;Later we meet her husband. &nbsp;They communicate via Google translate on their phone. &nbsp;She is Chinese and speaks no English, he no Chinese. &nbsp;Earlier on our walk we met a man looking for the Japanese garden which we later discover is magnificent. &nbsp;We never knew about it till now. &nbsp;The day is relatively warm for this time of year and peace is in the air. &nbsp;In the evening we watch a movie about Jim Morrison and the Doors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 10</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hb had breakfast at the Breadboard with Ginny Ross. &nbsp;In the afternoon we went over to the COOP to get some food. &nbsp;I went for a walk up the hill for the first time and then we had chicken for dinner. &nbsp;It rained in the morning but was nice in the afternoon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 11</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Great day in Talent. &nbsp;Got there after breakfast and parked at Chuck Robert&#39;s Park. &nbsp;From there we walked west to Rapp and Theo lane. &nbsp;Then turned around and walked into town the back way. &nbsp;We had a really nice lunch of gluten free pancakes and a Cobb salad. &nbsp;The proprietor Denise we met last time we ate there with Ginny. &nbsp;She lived in Hawaii many years and moved here to open up the restaurant 12 years ago. &nbsp;On the way back to our car we walked past a piece of property on the east side of Talent Ave for sale for 1.8 Million. &nbsp;It was 2.3 acres zoned for multiple units. &nbsp;In the evening we went to hear Grant Ruiz and Dan Fellman again at Belle Fiore winery. &nbsp;We heard them last Friday night at the gallery opening night and they were lovely. &nbsp;Hb and I ate a ton of food there including a large shisel of truffle fries. &nbsp;Hb and a Pinot Noir and she thought it was great. &nbsp;The winery was a big night out on the town for us and we were groupies as we conversed with the band members during and after their 2 sets. &nbsp;A nice time was had by all. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 12</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Left here by 9AM. &nbsp;Nice breakfast in Shasta at the Pastry shop. &nbsp;Sat next to an older man who went to Penn State 2 years before Dad. &nbsp;He was the editor of the website </span><span class="c4 c2"><a class="c5"

class="c1">&nbsp;needless to say, he was an interesting guy and we enjoyed speaking to him. &nbsp;Afterwards we hit the snow. &nbsp;It was the highlight of my whole entire year. &nbsp;It was heaven being up there. &nbsp;I had flashbacks to my days being out in Vail and being in the aura of the snow, stillness and life. &nbsp;It was beautiful. &nbsp;We walked one mile up there and one mile back and took some great pictures. &nbsp;Afterwards we hit the COOP in Mt. Shasta and had a nice little snack and then we drove home. &nbsp;We were home by dark. &nbsp;Gas cost less than $15 bucks @ 2.59 per gallon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 13</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hb went to get a massage and I chilled out at home. &nbsp;At the end of the day I did my first walk up the hill and around the block, but in reverse order which is not a great idea cause coming down Wimer is not that much fun with the traffic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 14</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Headed out Hwy 140 to just east of Milepost 24. &nbsp;It looks like this forest road is called Grizzly Road as it is the only one to cross the creek just after the turnoff. &nbsp;We turned on to the forest road and parked soon after the turnoff. &nbsp;We walked up to the snow line and was able to see Mt. McLoughlin from the forest road we were on. &nbsp;At around 2PM we headed over to TJ&#39;s to get some groceries then went to our favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. &nbsp;Got back to Ashland and Russ was getting ready to do some leaf blowing with his leaf blower. &nbsp;Hb went to the movies and I went back home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 15</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nice talk with John Zeuli. &nbsp;Hb went to lunch with Carol Stella. &nbsp;I never left the house today, Hb went to a Buddhist Meditation in the evening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 16</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After breakfast and when it cleared a bit we walked over to the university via Ashland St. &nbsp;We stopped off in the Music Center for a break and then continued on back to town. &nbsp;We had a nice lunch at the Standing Stone Brewery. &nbsp;Afterwards we stopped by a local gallery and met Launa who used to live in ABQ. &nbsp;She told us about the grocery store Shop n Kart; which we had never heard of before. &nbsp;A find to say the least. &nbsp;Our walk was under cloudy skies, but it didn&#39;t rain even though the day was kind of drizzly for the most part. &nbsp;We are half way through our November adventure in Ashland. &nbsp;At 5:30PM I walked Hb over to the Theatre so she could watch a movie. &nbsp;I walked back home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 17</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Long talk with Peter in the morning </span><span class="c4 c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://medium.com/@francescafontana/losing-louis-a180d44bcf08&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1514775574336000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEmIr3K5CrkRssMJWSs6_3A3Tp2iA">about this topic</a></span><span class="c2">. &nbsp;It was a glorious sunny day in Ashland and I was walking around the hood talking to Pedro. &nbsp;Afterwards we went on a hike with Ginny Ross up the trails into the park. &nbsp;She told us about </span><span class="c4 c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.beecityusa.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1514775574336000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH_QwsHjOS_18ypX28UNG-o9hpvZw">Bee City</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and her saga with the Talent City Council and the mayor. &nbsp;Afterwards we walked over to the place tomorrow morning where Hb will get her cut. &nbsp;We stopped by the COOP, I bought some bananas for $.25 a pound and some quionoa. &nbsp;We came home and ate the sausages we purchased at the Coop.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 18</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Went to the Armory in Medford and met </span><span class="c4 c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DFS3M4ItY_tA&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1514775574336000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGaWiyAZ3pNJitSuTSHOZYsLSx-tA">Jon King</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;who is from Corvallis but has a pottery Coop in Eugene. &nbsp;Prior to Jon we saw another woman who had been throwing pots for around 5 years. &nbsp;The Armory is adjacent to Walmart and bit north of downtown. &nbsp;So afterwards we headed downtown and met George who has been in his antique store for 28 years. &nbsp;He grew up in Springfield. &nbsp;We went over to the Thai restaurant west of town but it was chilly in there so we decided to come home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 19</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For the first time we went to our new favorite grocery store in Ashland called Shop&#39;n Kart. &nbsp;We also swung by Bi-mart and I got some supplements, MSM and Magnesium. &nbsp;It is my first time taking these supplements. &nbsp;Hb turned me on to them and it appears to be slightly helping with my leg issue of sciatica. &nbsp;Afterwards we went home, ate some lunch and then went back out for a walk down our new favorite walk around the block of Helman, Nevada, and Oak street. &nbsp;In the evening we watched Idaho outdoors, a show I have grown to love since moving to Oregon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 20</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a laundry day; our second since we arrived in Ashland and our only time doing our sheets. &nbsp;Afterwards we went back to Shop N Kart and I bought some winter squash. &nbsp;Hb went to the movie and I stayed at home. &nbsp;In the evening Jeff, Licia and the kids came by on their way to Thanksgiving in the Bay Area at Patty&#39;s house. &nbsp;We took them out to our favorite local brewery. &nbsp;It was great to see them. I had not seen them since last Thanksgiving.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 21</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Breakfast at Morning Glory followed by going out to the Buckhorn Springs area and heading up the Emigrant Springs Monument road and going to the parking lot. &nbsp;Afterwards we went out Buckhorn Springs road to the end, turned around, and hung out by the creek. &nbsp;Then over to the lake to hang out for awhile. &nbsp;Then we had dinner at Thai Pepper. &nbsp;After dinner we walkd around Ashland and spoke to my parents and Anya. &nbsp;The day was warm. &nbsp;We saw 67 degrees on the car themometer; an absolutely stellar birthday in Ashland.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 22</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Made winter squash in the morning. &nbsp;From there we went on a hike along the ditch that crosses Park St and goes all the way north past Indiana till it dead ends and make a right on Woodland and take that to the top of the hill. &nbsp;We came home and Hb made salmon, greens and winter squash.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 23</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thanksgiving dinner at Lark&#39;s at 3:45PM. &nbsp;It was raining slightly on our walk over; but the meal was great as always. &nbsp;Another Thanksgiving in the bag and on we go with life. &nbsp;Can not believe I am saying this but it sure beats shopping, cooking, cleaning up and everything in between.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 24</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hb and I were in the front of the parade of people in the Ashland Christmas parade. &nbsp;It was our 2nd time being in the front of the pack. &nbsp;The key is to hang out where the parade route begins across the street from the library and watch the parade from there. &nbsp;Then just after Santa passes by we file into the front. &nbsp;It worked like a charm for the 2nd time and we loved it. &nbsp;It was a gorgeous evening, not too cold and clear. &nbsp;No sight of rain or wet or damp. &nbsp;A perfect parade was had by all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 25</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Jacksonville all day, then Korean food in Medford for lunch. &nbsp;Met </span><span class="c6">Jack (Butch) Frost</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(</span><span>541-646&ndash; 8258</span><span class="c1">) at the Oddfellows Hall, Chapter 10. &nbsp;Butch reminded me of Glenn Larson very much. There is also a lodge in Grants Pass, Gold Hill and Central Point. &nbsp;So there are 4 lodges in the Valley. &nbsp;The ones in Medford and Ashland closed down a long time ago. &nbsp;After a late lunch we toured around by car in Phoenix and learned there is not much there. &nbsp;The weather today was fantastic and being in Jacksonville the Saturday after Thanksgiving was just perfect. &nbsp;We had fun there and meeting Butch Frost put the icing on the cake:)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 26</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First stop was the Armory for the holiday fair. &nbsp;We met Dan Clark the rock guy, interesting. &nbsp;Another guy Dennis made wood jewelery boxes and butcher block cutting boards. &nbsp;Dennis does all of the cooking, and his wife does the dishes. &nbsp;The holiday fair is a nice annual event. &nbsp;From there we went to the COOP for water and quinoa and then Shop n&#39; Kart for Gluten Free Oats. &nbsp;It was raining at the time. &nbsp;We came home chilled out for an hour and then did our big hike up to the top of the hill. &nbsp;It was Hb&#39;s first time up there this season and my second. &nbsp;We like that walk. &nbsp;We got home at 5:30PM just as it was getting dark.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 27</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mid afternoon I went for a walk around the block. &nbsp;Came home and Hb made turkey for us and beans; we love the beans. &nbsp;Earlier in the day I walked Hb over to her massage at 10AM. &nbsp;It was nice going for a walk in the morning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 28</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First time on the trip going on a big walk in the morning. &nbsp;Walked over to the extreme north edge of town; past Wimer and back through those streets I had never been on before. &nbsp;Then up Thornton to the top and when I hit Wimer I made a right and dropped back down into the drainage and crossed the creek for the first time. &nbsp;I had never gone to the end of Wimer and kept going before. &nbsp;So I explored some new cool territory today and was home by about 11:30AM.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 29</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hb and I had a great day in Jacksonville. &nbsp;We got there around 1PM and parked at the Britt. &nbsp;We then walked south through town on 3rd and continued on for aways. &nbsp;We turned around, came back into town and then through town to the other side. &nbsp;We stopped off at the Estate and then all the way over to the trail adjacent to the vineyard. &nbsp;It was a cold, wintry, partly cloudy day in OR and we were happy. &nbsp;It was one of the best days of the trip. &nbsp;I have been wanting to get to know Jacksonville for awhile and today was the day. &nbsp;On the way home Hb obliged me to my final meal at my favorite Mexican restaurant in OR. &nbsp;And this time we got the asada which was yummy and Hb was happy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 30</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mellow day at home packing and wrapping things up. &nbsp;At the end of the day we walked downtown, over to the ice rink, and through the park to the end of the street and then back on the road. &nbsp;It was our first time doing that walk. &nbsp;In fact, this whole trip I never walked up that street once. &nbsp;We walked in other parts of town this trip, and so a good trip in Ashland was had by all. &nbsp;See you back in Corvallis !</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p

Boyd</a></span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;He will be playing with Grant Ruiz in January. &nbsp; Its funny how our serendipitous meeting with Grant and Dan turned into our interest in not just Flamenco Guitar but also getting turned on to the Guitar Society. &nbsp;Afterwards we walked around a bit and then had dinner at the Bellhop. &nbsp;It was fun and we ate a lot of Fried Chicken, Mashed Potatoes, Collard Greens and Marion Berry Pie. &nbsp;The walk home from the restaurant was nice. &nbsp;Its winter in Corvallis, its cold, dark and lovely. &nbsp;Being with Hb as always make me feel good; and I am happy to be alive and living in Oregon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 17</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Up early. &nbsp;Drive on some back roads to

Espiga</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;which Bruce recommended to us later in the day when we saw him at the COOP. &nbsp;He told us he rides his bike up there from Corvallis, then turns around and goes home. &nbsp;He eats at La Espiga all the time. &nbsp;We, however, went to our favorite Mexican restaurant in Albany. &nbsp;Afterwards we stopped by the COOP then went home; and did a nice walk around the block prior to darkness. &nbsp;It is getting pitch dark here around 5:45PM or slightly sooner. &nbsp;As the day came to an end I walked outside to see the final light of day and above me passed the geese birds of winter in the WL Valley. &nbsp;This is now clearly my home, and NM is just a dream of mine from a distant memory years ago.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday

his bday, and had a nice long talk with Brian Wehrung in the afternoon. &nbsp;He was off from work for the holidays. &nbsp;Late in the day I did the WL Loop in the rain. &nbsp;It was my first walk in the rain this winter and the first one since returning from Ashland. &nbsp;It has been dry since our return which is unusual and the river is way down. &nbsp;Hb went to the OddFellows meeting in the evening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 20</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Went for a really nice walk from TJ&#39;s in the morning. &nbsp;Walked up to the park on Taylor

3:30PM and we went for a walk around the park. &nbsp;Then we went over to Scott&#39;s house and did a loop around the block. &nbsp;Came back to his house and had some brandy which was yummy. &nbsp;Then we went over to the Solstice gathering on Crystal Lake and walked over to the shelter at the end of Goodnight. &nbsp;It was my first time at the gathering and it was lovely. &nbsp;Afterwards we walked up to Cheryl and Michael&#39;s house and had a bonfire. &nbsp;I got home around 10PM. &nbsp;Hb did her solstice gathering with Skye and Anya and had a nice time as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 22</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Stayed home all day and went nowhere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 23</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hb and I went out to the Arboretum and went for a lovely walk around noon. &nbsp;The day was damp, but no rain and it was our first time out in the forest

24</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dinner at Peter&#39;s house with Nancy. &nbsp;Peter served lamb which was yummy. &nbsp;We got there at 4PM and left around 8PM. &nbsp;The fire was lovely

for a beautiful Christmas dinner. &nbsp;We sat around the table and ate some beautiful food. &nbsp;We did a brief farolita walk afterwards. &nbsp;The weather today was gorgeous, sunny and warm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 26</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a cold one today and Hb and I walked over to the river and observed how low the water level was. &nbsp;In previous years its been above the island, this year Hb estimates its at least 10 feet down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 27</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the afternoon we went for a walk and saw Mushroom and Linda. &nbsp;It was a beautiful warm afternoon, compared to yesterday when it was cold and slightly windy. &nbsp;We were happy to be walking around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 28</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I went for a walk by myself after doing some leaves in the backyard and digging 2 holes. &nbsp;It was a short walk as it was slightly rainy but warm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 29</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Very nice live band Kirtan session. &nbsp;Met Anand who moved here from Ca. and is orginally from India. &nbsp;He was part of the meetup. &nbsp;They had their year end cookies which was nice too. &nbsp;I spoke to Kitzie&#39;s husband Bill for the first time. &nbsp;He got a new board that takes in all of the channels for 600.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 30</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Absolutely gorgeous, super fantastic day. &nbsp;Started working outside right after breakfast. &nbsp;We cleaned up the backyard, finished up raking, and then I pruned some black berries on the side yard. &nbsp;Then we ate a nice lunch and went for a walk. &nbsp;On the way we ran into Pedro and so we went over to his house for awhile. &nbsp;Then we went shopping at TJ&#39;s and the VC and the COOP. &nbsp;At the COOP we ran into Jim and his friend Bob. &nbsp;We have seen Jim twice in the past couple of weeks. &nbsp;We met him last year at Kent&#39;s potluck. &nbsp;This year Kent did not have a potluck, but we got to hang out with Jim just the same.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 31</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The year is winding down on a good note. &nbsp;The final day of 2017 ended on a very good note. &nbsp;We went for a ride and checked out the new houses on the hill overlooking the Mary&#39;s River Basin where we ride our bikes on the back road. &nbsp;Then we headed over to Findley NWR and passed Bonnie and Dan&#39;s new house along the way. &nbsp;Our walk in Findley was on a new trail we had never been on before called the Woodpecker loop. &nbsp;While we were there we got a New Year&#39;s text from Naj and a nice phone call from JohnG. &nbsp;He is down in the southern part of the USA near San Diego and Tucson. &nbsp;We came home and had our famous turkey and beans meal for New Year&#39;s Eve. &nbsp;Earlier in the day I spoke to Iris.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
