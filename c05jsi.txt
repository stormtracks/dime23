Major awakening day on project as I back pedaled a bit and got scared and decided to "go out and get a job". In other words, run away from my project instead of hitting hard what needs to be done and that is major push into picture generation on the project via JFreeChart. Also, insight into the value of the HotJobs web site. Its not about sending out the resumes, but instead, on taking the names off the web site and calling directly the interested parties. The previous strategy of just sending out hundreds of resumes hoping for one hit which would be a phone call or one homerun which would be a job just doesn't work BECAUSE you are a special case in many ways. The most obvious anomaly is your checkbox which says, "will not re-located". Ninety-Nine out of one hundred people will take your resume and put it in the bit bucket. So, I ask, why spend the time sending out 100 resumes when your success rate is 1 percent. Seems to me that you would like to use your time more efficiently. Or better yet, call those people instead, take their pulse, and increase your odds of getting a hit, or the goal which is a homerun.
Wednesday 27
Spoke to Mom on her birthday. For the first time in my life I got reflection up and running in Java, very cool. I am now able to kick out pie chart pictures given a column name for a set of symbols.

This is our second session where all we do is speak Spanish, this is very cool.

Drove to Las Vegas for lunch at a pretty good place off the Plaza. Looked around for block ice, the only place in town that has it, is the Chevron next to Wal Mart on the north side of town. Drove out to Mills Canyon, and arrived several hours before dark. It took us awhile as usual to find a "spot" and then a flat place for our tent.
Saturday 20
Nice mellow camping morning, followed by our traditional walk. I went swimming in the Canadian river and so did puppy. Nap in afternoon as it rained, it cleared up. Glorious walk in evening to Mills old stone house. We read the history on Mills, and he was quite a character.
Sunday 21
Since it rained the night before and I was nervous about making it of the canyon in our car, we awoke, packed up quickly and left. As is usually the case in life, the worrying was wasted. The road was fine, and so we decided to eat breakfast at an overlook above the canyon prior to the top. It was a glorious day, and we had a nice breakfast of ground turkey and sausage. We hung for awhile and then proceeded on our way across the Kiowa Natl Grasslands to Roy. The morning was splendid, and the air had a tinge of autumn. Roy is NOT happening, we won't be moving there. Drove to the Baptist Center in Glorieta and had a nice lunch, then on home. There we dried out our stuff, and rapped with Andy.

Got a call back yesterday from Michael Bruce, one of Charlie Peterson's contact people. Also, harvested the basil from the ground, basil grows best in the front away from the wall instead of in the back near the wall, I don't think there is enough light in the back, but its probably good for some type of crop.

More understanding of Acegi. Got the stand-alone contact demo up and running in my framework. The key was grabbing the Acegi CVS snap shot, and then installing maven. Acegi built out of the box with Maven which is a really good sign. The next good sign is how clean the API is, this is a very nice, slick, well designed product, which gives me what I want which is a cookie based system to stores a users credentials and also tap into other security systems if needed later on in the development process. Had a nice talk with Iris today, this is considered our Qtrly conference call.

In 20 minutes I ascended the peak, and then walked along the ridge for about 40 minutes. On my descent I got a bit cold, but as I descended I started to warm up.
Monday 14
Got to work really early and officially resigned from the Vaad.
