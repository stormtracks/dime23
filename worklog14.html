When my job at Spinnakr came to a close on June 10 I moved into learning elasticsearch in the context of Angular.js. &nbsp;I also updated my Craig app to publish data into elasticsearch so it could be viewed by angular. &nbsp;When my job at Spinnakr comes to a close I will get back into using this as my new UI to see the new job postings. &nbsp;For now, all my energy will go into Go until Spinnakr comes to a close. &nbsp;I used Redis, LLVM, and chrome as a model to dive back into C. We will do another recap soon, but for now suffice it to say that the turning point in the year was on August 6. &nbsp;That was the day that I got golang up and running on my machine. &nbsp;So in the end I satisfied my goal of getting into a new language in a big way. &nbsp;Instead of C it turned out to be Go.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span

back into Angular after taking the July 4 holiday off I am even more impressed with it. &nbsp;And having a KILLER example like Kibana to really understand and sink my teeth into Angular is huge.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">7/8/2014</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Starting to work on OAuth2.0 for gmail api.</span></p><p

testing in Ruby. &nbsp;At the very end of last week I realized I needed to understand the testing system in Diaspora since I had a basic handle on the flow of things and the basics of the Backbone code. The testing infrastructure is VERY interesting. &nbsp;This is day 2 of my real indepth look into testing and I like it ALOT. &nbsp;The testing system is really a whole different world and completely independent from the actual runtime system except it uses the same classes and database system.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">6/28</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">I am ending my first week of a model Ruby on Rails project called Diaspora. &nbsp;Today I learned as day turned to night how exactly the rendering process happens from the controller. &nbsp;It is in the docs, but I had to get the connection between sometimes the controller explicitly stating the render method and specifying the view and sometimes not. &nbsp;It is the sometimes not that was eluding me at the moment. &nbsp;I am having fun, keep going. &nbsp;This is the platform in which to embed your Backbone application. &nbsp;Prior to this foray into Ruby on Rails. &nbsp;Backbone did not have a place to live and now it does.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">06/26</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">Day Two of Diaspora. &nbsp;This is a great model system just like OPower for Node and Bookmarkly for Backbone. &nbsp;The HUGE big win I discovered last night is that Diaspora also uses Backbone. &nbsp;BINGO ! &nbsp;We are happy.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">06/25</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">First day working on Diaspora. &nbsp;I got it up and running by lunchtime, installed MySql and the MySql workbench. &nbsp;This is great news and will be an awesome way to take my Ruby and Rails skills to the next level. &nbsp;Way better than hacking on CRdata. &nbsp;But then again once I get passed this step then maybe CRdata will be a snap if I so choose to go there.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">06/24</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">Back to work after a nice week off in Silver City. &nbsp;The next couple of weeks will be focused on Ruby, Rails, and other things associated with these two topics. &nbsp;Got the src code for rails up and running. &nbsp;Rvm is the key to getting all of this stuff going.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">06/14</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">Early in the morning, just as the first light hit. &nbsp;I discovered, rvm, ruby version manager, and ruby, rails, et al was up and running on my computer. &nbsp;From there, I started playing with Rails. &nbsp;It is the first time ever I have run a rails app on a macbook pro. &nbsp;This is really super fantastic news !</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">06/13</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">Now that Twitter is up and running the next step is to realize that the whole idea behind what I am doing is to understand the content better. &nbsp;So whether it be Craigslist descriptions or a set of Tweets from a group of people it would be great to do some simple NLP and so that is where the Natural package comes into play. &nbsp;I did some work today on their package in natural called tf*idf [term frequency -- inverse document frequency]. &nbsp;This brought me to the realization about WORK. &nbsp;If I am going to get a job I need to broaden my scope to include Ruby on Rails jobs and Django jobs in the Python world. &nbsp;So here we go --- off to just review enough of this stuff to possibly get a job in this area.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">06/12</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">Twitter is up and running in &nbsp;a

Julie as Sima is heading out to Europe tomorrow. &nbsp;Now that things with Marionette and Jobase are starting to fall into place I am going to go back and generate out a larger craig dataset. &nbsp;While doing this it occurs to me as well that it would be nice to be able to do things with the LARGE craig dataset like pull all of the items from 5 cities a,b,c,d,e etc... Also, it would be great to randomly pull 1000 entries or 100 entries from the larger json structure. &nbsp;So it is back to Craig and data to wrap this up prior to the release of jobase on github.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">05/28 &nbsp;jobasec00ah, must00alb</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">At the end of Monday on Memorial Day I got things in pretty good shape. &nbsp;I am starting to better understand Marionette. &nbsp;I worked all weekend, the whole time that the kids were here.

Yes, spent more time looking at ember as well. &nbsp;So, I think we are good with these three, but maybe angular.js as well. &nbsp;I will post here.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span

Derick Bailey. &nbsp;It was a Monday morning and I was cruising through a blog post about Backbone.js from a guy in Halifax who had written a short demo app about Donuts. &nbsp;And in one of those posts there was a comment by someone who said to take a look at Derick&rsquo;s project. &nbsp;Life works this way, sometimes you just get lucky or turn over the right rock. &nbsp;When you turn over that rock you know you have found something good. &nbsp;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for the past couple of weeks of hard work on Backbone I would not have realized that I &ldquo;needed&rdquo; Marionette, but now I know I do and it will make my backbone coding adventure much more pleasant and rewarding.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">04/15</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">I worked all weekend on trying to get Tab Views to work only to discover that it was a harder problem than I originally thought.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">04/14</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">Based on code I wrote in Argentina and using Backbone.js as a model I got name spacing working for the first time in my backbone code. &nbsp;Also, beginning to work on the &ldquo;Tabs&rdquo; problem and being able to run multiple views in the same application. &nbsp;This is NOT a trivial problem. &nbsp;My initial hit on it did NOT work which was to try and use of the shelf code. &nbsp;So tomorrow I will spend more time looking at the problem and report back to you.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">04/13</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">OK. &nbsp;So the CSS is working and the tabs are working as well. &nbsp;Now I need to throw all of my content into templates so that there is no static HTML hanging around. &nbsp;Everything needs to be dynamic. &nbsp;Only div&rsquo;s with ID&rsquo;s can be static. &nbsp;But any other content that hangs around can not be gotten rid of quickly. &nbsp;So I will go to the next step. &nbsp;A product called Meteor was

time I have a structure called BOOTSTRAP in which to work with. &nbsp;So I have something to base all of my work on and a nice model to be able to use as my basis of learning.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">04/11</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">Now that Backbone is in pretty good shape a deep dive into Bootstrap and less in order to be able to drive everything else forward. &nbsp;So I would call this Day ONE of CSS.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">04/10</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">I have been working on Backbone now for about two weeks full time and I believe it is starting to sink in. &nbsp;Today, after much thinking and research I moved to a one model, multiple view system. &nbsp;The first insight into this was an application called Funky Calendar. &nbsp;From there, I decided that going with multiple views made sense and finally got circles up on the screen being driven by the check boxes. &nbsp;We are making HUGE progress on Backbone.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">04/08</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">On this beautiful Sunday morning I finally got D3 and Backbone working. &nbsp;I was able to put three circles on the screen with colors that were read from localStorage.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">04/05</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">I discovered that Mustache templating looks to be the way to go while hanging out at the library across from Academy waiting to eat lunch with Dan at the Thai restaurant near JSI. &nbsp;Embers.js uses Handlebars as their templating engine and Handlebars is a superset of Mustache. &nbsp;I believe this will be a slightly more robust solution that what I am currently using which is Underscore micro-templating.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">04/04</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">Spent the whole weekend while Hb was in Denver at Ashley&rsquo;s baby shower for Tanner working on Backbone.js. &nbsp; This is my first foray into this product and the concept is very cool. &nbsp;I will report further progress here.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">3/29</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">When I initially started out with Node.js and Express, &ldquo;OPower&rdquo; was my ticket to understanding. &nbsp;The same is now true for understanding Backbone. &nbsp;I need something that I can wrap my head around to understand this concept and it turns out that Bookmarkly is it. &nbsp;Very, very cool.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">3/28</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">OK --- I just realized I do not have to put the year down on each entry, this is good news. &nbsp;It will just show up every once in a while. &nbsp;I am starting to make huge progress in understanding Backbone. &nbsp;Bookmarkly and a couple of other examples are serving as great leads for understanding this stuff. &nbsp;Also, last evening I started diving back into the D3 examples. &nbsp;It will be a combination of these two things that drives the web site moving forward.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 3/27/2012</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c7 c0">First day of Front end work. &nbsp;Looking into D3 and Backbone at the moment.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c11 c7"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">Monday 3/26/2012</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">Figured out (finally) how github web pages work. &nbsp;Turns out the magic sauce is a branch called &ldquo;gh-pages&rdquo;. &nbsp;See my email for more examples.</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">Finished up the first round of the Craigslist project. &nbsp;Tomorrow I am moving on to the front end which is D3 and Backbone and Bootstrap.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">3/24/2012</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">Total re-write of the way craig data is retrieved. &nbsp;I am now doing it correctly and no longer using a phony counter to drive the event system. &nbsp;Now it is all call back based. &nbsp;I also switched over to request from wwwdude. &nbsp;Also, I am storing all of the data I retrieve in Redis. &nbsp;I have also generated out a report so I know exactly how much data is associated with each city. &nbsp;We are making good progress here.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">3/23/2012</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">The way connections work in Mongo and Craig overall is now working and I am generating out HTML content which looks great ! &nbsp;Now I will move on to getting the events from reading the content to storing the content.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">3/21/2012</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">Streaming is now working using Clarinet. &nbsp;This is great news ! &nbsp;We now have a very nice way to stream data off the internet and into a file and eventually Mongo as well. &nbsp;Also, I am able to stream data out of Mongo now, as of today, using CursorStream which is very cool. &nbsp;I am pretty sure it does not work in Mongode, however. &nbsp;But streaming works in Mongoose. &nbsp;My initial cut was using the native Mongo driver. &nbsp;We are making lots of progress on streaming which is going to be mission critical going forward.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">3/19/2012</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">Spent the weekend looking at streams and in the end I found a buried treasure called Clarinet. &nbsp; This piece of technology along with many others WILL take me to the next level.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">3/17/2012</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">Streams are HUGE and I am just starting to understand WHY they are so important in my application and future applications.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">3/16/2012</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">Struggled all day Friday trying to get Promises to work when in the end I realized all I really needed to do was do a callback which would have solved the problem. &nbsp;You only really need promises if you are waiting on multiple returns of different pieces of information. &nbsp;For example if you go out to Mongo and Redis at the same time and need both pieces of information to move forward. &nbsp;Or in the case of MileWise they needed results from all of the different airlines and then they could move forward.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">3/12/2012</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">Redid schema to further align with future

class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">Big weekend of work, sending out resumes. &nbsp;Looking at the Twitter Feed and determining that this is probably not the call for &ldquo;now&rdquo;. &nbsp;Also, &nbsp;got Haraka up and running on Amazon. &nbsp;I am able to send outbound emails to both sfi and gmail. &nbsp;This is pretty darn cool.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">3/9/2012</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">Back from a lovely trip to Sedona and Flagstaff. &nbsp;This week was all CSS, mainly integrating Bootstrap into the Backbone application todo and the D3 word cloud.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">2/29/2012</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">First day of working on Bootstrap as I extend my reach into the Front End Ui World. &nbsp;This is rather exciting as I will be bridging both front and back end work.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">2/28/2012</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">Finish up first round of word cloud. &nbsp;It is ready to go for RedFork. &nbsp;This turned out to be done extremely quickly. &nbsp;Wow, I am happy.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">2/27/2012</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span

c1"><span class="c0">Today I had a huge day of work. &nbsp;The xml2js solution is working for me now that I installed a new version of it and set the Option &lsquo;explicitArray&rsquo;. &nbsp;Also, I am now persisting my data model to Redis and the daoJobRedis is now driving the UI as well. &nbsp;So we are able to store data in both Mongoose and Redis and then use the dao so the UI&rsquo;s work.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">2/20/2012</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">It has come to my attention that I need to have a separate work log from my c-series diary. &nbsp;Moving forward, my work schedule is going to be more sporadic and so I need to be able to chart a path forward by looking back. &nbsp;So it is only appropriate on Eve Tolpa&rsquo;s birthday 2012 that I begin this new parallel series of work and play. &nbsp;Although, at times I will outline my work and play together, it probably makes more sense to divide the two worlds as they should.</span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">2/10/2012</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0">This is my final day in Florida. &nbsp;During the first week I concentrated on writing data out to Mongo. &nbsp;I would parse the BioGrid files using the CSV parser and then write the data out to BioGrid using Mongode the tool written by Vinay at MileWise. &nbsp;The second week in Florida was all about D3. </span></p><p class="c2 c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span
