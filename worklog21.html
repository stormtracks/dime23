whole big giant polars / arrow stack. &nbsp;also as can be seen from the previous entry JT and I discussed this issue a day or two ago; and then yesterday morning as I was weighing on my reedline nu-completer project it came to me that why not bust up nu-protocol and have the nu-parser dependencies be separate. &nbsp;I mulled this idea for a few hours and then ran it by JT and at that moment all of the stars aligned </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6"

here. &nbsp;My path in my work is all related and clearly this fork on the trail is related to my work the past number of months with nushell. &nbsp;We are at a point in the product where building a

me and a testament to the ease of use of mdbook, which is rock solid.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday Oct 31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think I now finally am starting to understand the whole type system and what it is all about for nushell. &nbsp;I think the light went on when I started thinking about html template engines in the context of zola as well as what is going on with serde json and how the output that you see whether it be json, a nushell table, or an html page is moving the data through the Value to what the end user sees. &nbsp;More on this later.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday Oct 26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I went back the other day and found out that the first day I started programming in Rust was on Scott&#39;s birthday 2019. &nbsp;It has now been well over a year and I consider myself a bit more than a beginner, but at least I am still focused on the language, and becoming more knowledgable. &nbsp;Today I came back in once again to review Chapter 13 of the Rust Book on closures and iterators. &nbsp;They are all over the nushell code and so I need to fully understand the concepts. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday Oct 25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I learned today that mdbook allows us to copy the complete theme directory over to your local mdbook repo where you are creating the book and then it will use those themes instead of the default ones in the binary. &nbsp;This means that I don&#39;t need to have my own custom copy of mdbook lying around but can simply embed the theme files I need for each particular mdbook repo that I create. &nbsp;So even though the odd fellow mdbook needs some changes, another mdbook may want other ones.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday Oct 24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Worked on a website for Bonnie and Oddfellows and had some minor breakthroughs. &nbsp;First I decided to use mdBook and was able to fix the sidebar so it stayed open by default and reduced the sidebar from 300px to 200px giving the user a lot more realestate on the right side. &nbsp;I like mdBook and will continue to use it more and more in other projects; plus it is written in Rust !</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span

with the futures crate. &nbsp;So basically we are doing a deep dive into everything behind futures in relation to nushell. &nbsp;This is actually the first time I have revisited this concept since working with Tokio awhile back and the first time looking at it since I started working on nushell back in July 2020. &nbsp;Its amazing how all of this stuff doesn&#39;t really stick around in my

messages either to a file or to the console. &nbsp;It works exactly like I wanted it to. &nbsp;Once I figured out flexi_logger this afternoon I had the whole main.rs nushell file pared down and back up and running with the new logging code in about 1 hour. &nbsp;Very cool ! &nbsp;Rust logging is working the way it should, and nushell is very well designed from a logging perspective... &nbsp;Once you understand this stuff it is really trivial and easy. &nbsp;Today was an example of how things fall into place. &nbsp;However, it took me a number of days to finally get here and come up with this simple solution.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday Sep 25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A week has passed. &nbsp;We are now deep into how Rust logging works. &nbsp;I want to integrate a new logging solution into the Nushell code for personal use. &nbsp;For now, the focus is as simple as; writing the log data out to file instead of stdout. &nbsp;(I think)...</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday Sep 18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moving quickly, I now understand that nu-table is the crate that draws the table data. &nbsp;I now need to work out exactly how this data gets fed to draw_table and when a table is drawn and when one is not... &nbsp;As always, more work to do. &nbsp;But I have gotten past the parser for now, and moved on to the other side of the equation. &nbsp;There is a lot more to understand with nushell; but I think we are making progress. &nbsp;Stay tuned here for more details :)</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wed Sep 16</span></p><p class="c1"><span

into the nushell discord which is giving me a big insight as to how nushell works. &nbsp;Today I downloaded the first version just to get a glimpse of the original ideas behind the program. &nbsp;In concert with this info, I was able to convert the ui xbrl 10q file into a table and then back into json and the whole thing worked. &nbsp;This is amazing ! &nbsp;Also spent some time looking at toml to get a handle on their very simple, very intuitive format. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday August 20</span></p><p class="c1"><span

out exactly what data points in the 10Q&#39;s are associated with what particular contexts but this for now is where all of the work will be going upon return. &nbsp;Capturing all of the data is possibly a function of getting the correct 3 month intervals associated contexts. &nbsp;That is step 1. &nbsp;Getting all of the associated quarterly data.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once this is done then you can move on to getting the annual data. &nbsp;And lastly the 2 quarters / 6 months and 3 quarters / 9 months worth of data.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But for now just getting all of the 3 month data is not obvious as the current 2 context id&#39;s that I am

class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So the year is ending on a good note, and my rust skills are in pretty good shape. &nbsp;I am finally starting to feel a bit productive, after starting to code in Rust on Scott&#39;s bday this year, so its been over 5 months now.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Today I got the code working to rebuild a json document based on the keys in the tantivy schema. &nbsp;It involved using a Map from serde-json, crossbeam channels for the first time, HashSets. &nbsp;I am pretty confident I can take a few weeks off from coding while I am back home in NM and get right back into some time in mid January once I am back home in OR.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p

up and running, and pretty much understand how it works. &nbsp;Will outline the next steps in coming days. &nbsp;But for now I got the data coming from Hn and going into Redis, Sled, and Files which is where I wanted to get to. &nbsp;Now I am going to get up and running with easily getting the data into Tantivy.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span

lifetimes example working noted in last Friday&#39;s entry. &nbsp;This is kind of HUGE and the next step in learning Rust. &nbsp;As I look over the Rust Book and what I still don&#39;t know, this was something I definitely needed to get down. &nbsp;So now I can take the rest of the day off :) &nbsp;See you in Florida. &nbsp;Its been a very productive time in Rust land here in Pittsburgh. &nbsp;I pretty much worked almost every single day and didn&#39;t take any days off while I was home. &nbsp;So until I get back to Oregon in mid January you can rest assured knowing you aren&#39;t a slacker when it comes to work :)</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday Dec 06, 2019</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I have been coding in Rust pretty much every day since arriving here in Pittsburgh and from the beginning on July 10. &nbsp;Today is the first time I ran into the borrow checker, lifetimes, and ownership, so this is pretty cool.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Here is the problem. &nbsp;I am reading data out of a file and passing that data into a Vector which then gets passed along somewhere else. &nbsp;The line iterator of the file owns the data and I want to be able to have a lifetime stating that the data lives on after the line iterator goes out of scope but the vector still can have a reference to the data.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fact that I am able to create a problem that uses these concepts is pretty cool. &nbsp;This may take a while to wrap my head around so stay tuned.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p
