In other words, run away from my project instead of hitting hard what needs to be done and that is major push into picture generation on the project via JFreeChart. Also, insight into the value of the HotJobs web site. Its not about sending out the resumes, but instead, on taking the names off the web site and calling directly the interested parties. The previous strategy of just sending out hundreds of resumes hoping for one hit which would be a phone call or one homerun which would be a job just doesn&#39;t work BECAUSE you are a special case in many ways. The most obvious anomaly is your checkbox which says, &quot;will not re-located&quot;. Ninety-Nine out of one hundred people will take your resume and put it in the bit bucket. So, I ask, why spend the time sending out 100 resumes when your success rate is 1 percent. Seems to me that you would like to use your time more efficiently. Or better yet, call those people instead, take their pulse, and increase your odds of getting a hit, or the goal which is a homerun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Wednesday 27</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Spoke to Mom on her birthday. For the first time in my life I got reflection up and running in Java, very cool. I am now able to kick out pie chart pictures given a column name for a set of symbols.

Looked around for block ice, the only place in town that has it, is the Chevron next to Wal Mart on the north side of town. Drove out to Mills Canyon, and arrived several hours before dark. It took us awhile as usual to find a &quot;spot&quot; and then a flat place for our tent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Saturday 20</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Nice mellow camping morning, followed by our traditional walk. I went swimming in the Canadian river and so did puppy. Nap in afternoon as it rained, it cleared up. Glorious walk in evening to Mills old stone house. We read the history on Mills, and he was quite a character.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sunday 21</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Since it rained the night before and I was nervous about making it of the canyon in our car, we awoke, packed up quickly and left. As is usually the case in life, the worrying was wasted. The road was fine, and so we decided to eat breakfast at an overlook above the canyon prior to the top. It was a glorious day, and we had a nice breakfast of ground turkey and sausage. We hung for awhile and then proceeded on our way across the Kiowa Natl Grasslands to Roy. The morning was splendid, and the air had a tinge of autumn. Roy is NOT happening, we won&#39;t be moving there. Drove to the Baptist Center in Glorieta and had a nice lunch, then on home.

This is a long term decision and one that needs to be funded to the tune of $200 per month in health care expenses. Its part of the cost of doing business in America.

The key was grabbing the Acegi CVS snap shot, and then installing maven. Acegi built out of the box with Maven which is a really good sign. The next good sign is how clean the API is, this is a very nice, slick, well designed product, which gives me what I want which is a cookie based system to stores a users credentials and also tap into other security systems if needed later on in the development process. Had a nice talk with Iris today, this is considered our Qtrly conference call.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Saturday 08</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Hb, Andy and I got wood and stacked for the winter.

Hb and I had once hiked from Tunnel Springs but we went around the long way and never got where we were going. This time upon arrival I met a man who was with his young daughter who told me that a trail existed from the base that went right up the shoot to the top. In 20 minutes I ascended the peak, and then walked along the ridge for about 40 minutes. On my descent I got a bit cold, but as I descended I started to warm up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Monday 14</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Got to work really early and officially resigned from the Vaad. This was a difficult decision, but politically one I had to make as I could not sign off on the fact that we were going to hire a new Rabbi even though we did not have the money to do so. I am really glad with this decision even though it was harrowing for about two weeks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Tuesday 15</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Meeting with Marci and went over my bullshit of saying nothing matters in life.

Today was the Placitas Holiday Fair signalling the beginning of the Holiday Season. Hb and I love this time of year and our annual trek to the Holiday Fair is always a joyous occasion. Kathy, Jim Fish&#39;s wife, at the winery told me that it wouldn&#39;t be a Holiday Fair unless I was sitting by the fireplace. This year was very warm, the warmest Holiday Fair on record and thus the fireplace was not going.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sunday 20</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Hb and I go for a walk in the afternoon in the Village of Placitas. We hung out on a wall in front of someone&#39;s yard and talked for hours about our lives and our issues. It has been a very peaceful, eventful life with Hb.
