and bringing it outside the fence and filling it up and carting that to the dumpster. &nbsp;In the evening we hung out in the driveway with Jan, Mindy, Patrick and Izzy and let the 4th of July celebration happen all around us. &nbsp;Prior to our hang out, Patrick, Izzy and I went for a walk around the Crystal Lake block with Izzy&rsquo;s new bike with training wheels. &nbsp;Hb was surprised how noisy the the fireworks were all around us, as last year she was in the Bay Area with Nancy, Angie, and Laurie.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 05</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tai Chi in the morning, then Ken and I swung by Charles Goodrich&rsquo;s house and I met him for the first time. &nbsp;He lives on Crystal Lake and Ken goes there every year for yellow plums.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 06</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Drove up I5 to Portland and stopped at Trader Joe&rsquo;s on 21st and Glisan. &nbsp;Then drive up Hwy 30 to Rainier and had lunch at a Mexican restaurant on the Columbia. &nbsp;Arrive in Olympia around 3PM and checked into the Red Lion Hotel. &nbsp;Then sat by the pool for an hour and went into town and walked around the wharf. &nbsp;Hiked up to the Capitol Bldg and then back down to our car. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 07</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Breakfast at an Indian restaurant downtown Olympia. &nbsp;Afterwards we went out to Evergreen State College and hiked down to the Sound and sat on a log for awhile. &nbsp;The college is lovely. &nbsp;Back into town and dinner at a nice cafe across from the park. &nbsp;Hang at the swimming pool and went to bed early.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 08</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Up at 5:30AM, breakfast in Port Angeles after securing a ticket on the 12:45PM ferry. &nbsp;Ride to Victoria we met some Sikhs from Eugene and Espanola. &nbsp;Checked into our hotel the James Bay Inn on Government Street. &nbsp;Walked around downtown and then had a nice dinner near the Thriftway Grocery store a couple of blocks from our hotel. &nbsp;Victoria is a lovely town.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 09</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Morning drive around Victoria to the eastern edge of the island and then north to MacKenzie. &nbsp;Went to the museum and saw some cool exhibits on the native peoples and gold. &nbsp;In the afternoon had some lunch, walked around, then dinner at an asian vegetarian restaurant on johnson.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 10</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Drive north and had breakfast on the way at the Pioneer House. &nbsp;Then made a right turn on Bench Road and ended up in Chemainus where we had a lovely talk with an older couple. &nbsp;She was from England and he was a bush pilot for many years. &nbsp;They were in their upper 80&rsquo;s. &nbsp;Arrived in Parksville and walked along the beach and a Sand Castle building contest. &nbsp;Had a nice dinner at Leftys and then I went for a walk up the hill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 11</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gluten free large pizza for dinner with pineapple and chicken at Lefty&rsquo;s. &nbsp;Went to the Farmer&rsquo;s Market in Errington then Coombs to see Goats on the Roof. &nbsp;Follow up with Cathedral Grove in MacMillan Provincial Park where we saw some 800 year old trees. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 12</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I really liked staying in Parksville at the Sandcastle Inn. &nbsp;The place is clean, the staff is superb and the area genuine and classic Vancouver Island. &nbsp;I would come back here again, for sure, and use this as a base for my up island travels. &nbsp;The Farmer&rsquo;s Market in Errington was a classic hippy one. &nbsp;It was one of the best farmer&rsquo;s markets I have been to outside of Corvallis. &nbsp;The people were friendly, the date and lemon squares delicious, and the ambience rustic. &nbsp;Our journey has been challenging in some ways, but traveling in general is challenging. &nbsp;If you are by yourself you have your own issues, and the same with your partner and yourself. &nbsp;So Hb and I have learned some things along the way, and enjoyed the island and the beauty. &nbsp;Our first stop was the park just east of Parksville. &nbsp;We met some guys from Canada who was having a family reunion in the shelter. &nbsp;We talked to them for at least 45 minutes about life in Canada. &nbsp;Then we headed on down to Nanaimo to the neck park and walked around the park. &nbsp;We were there for about 2 hours and then headed to our hotel Howard Johnsons. &nbsp;It was a basic hotel, our most basic one on the trip but definitely passable. We walked downtown and had a nice dinner of Hb salmon and me brie cheese with chicken sandwich. &nbsp;Then walked back through the walkway and up to Bowen Park. &nbsp;On the way home we walked by and watched some tango. &nbsp;We basically saw the whole town and got a hit about what this place is about. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 13</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Up at 6AM, walk down to the harbor and around the area. &nbsp;Checked out, had breakfast up the road at a bakery. &nbsp;Then on to the ferry. &nbsp;Had a great talk on the ferry with Jim, he lives near Goats on the Roof. &nbsp;We talked the whole trip. &nbsp;He used to be a tugboat engineer but got into solar power later in life. &nbsp;We talked about Nuclear generators, cold fusion, et al. &nbsp;He knew the waterways and showed me around. &nbsp;Crossed into the USA around 1PM, and then on to Bellingham for a nice full day. &nbsp;Had lunch at a nice Thai restaurant and then bummed around downtown until the start of the Amy Winehouse movie. &nbsp;Incredibly excellent flick about her short, glamourous life. &nbsp;Afterwards we caught the sunset and the light. &nbsp;Staying at the Lion&rsquo;s Inn Motel @ 2419 Elm Street in Bellingham.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 14</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Up at 6AM. &nbsp;Walk around the hood in Bellingham, then breakfast downtown. &nbsp;In the afternoon we headed out to the park east of town where there are falls and trails. &nbsp;In the evening we headed over to the COOP for a nice dinner and then walked around out on the western edge of town out near the Indian Res on the peninsula west of town.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 15</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we woke up and had breakfast at the same spot as yesterday, just downtown right where holly starts. &nbsp;We parked right before the paid parking. &nbsp;The drive south was nice. &nbsp;Until you hit I5 on Hwy 11 it is gorgeous. &nbsp;From there it gets more busy. &nbsp;But the space between is lovely. &nbsp;The Kitsnap peninsula isn&rsquo;t that great. &nbsp;We had a nice lunch on the water, but our car was next to a kind of a weird guy --- and the energy of that through it off. &nbsp;In either case, we drove to McDonalds in Tacoma and signed up for a final night back in Olympia at the Red Lion Inn. &nbsp;It is only appropriate that we started the trip there and ended the trip there. &nbsp;We had a nice mellow dinner downtown at a Vietnamese restaurant and talked to the nice waitress. &nbsp;She seemed kind of bored with her job, in a good way. &nbsp;We talked about how expensive Canada was as she had been there before. &nbsp;We left her a nice tip, and then walked around downtown a bit. &nbsp;There were 2 festivals going on, in 2 parks fairly close by both with live bands. &nbsp;We then drove east out of town, hit the Arco for gas, and then caught I5 and drove south back to our hotel. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 16</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nice buffet breakfast at the hotel. &nbsp;Leave Olympia at 10:30AM arrive home at 2:30PM,

&nbsp;Made a cucumber potluck dish for the evening at Bina&rsquo;s farm. &nbsp;Linda Edwards joined us at Bina&rsquo;s along with Pedro and Ken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 20</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Went for a run and did the whole distance for the first time since last winter. &nbsp;I was surprised I made it the whole way, heart was feeling good and not hurting, so it must be a mental thing. &nbsp;In the evening Hb and I went for a bike ride over to the new road on Summerfield, across to the end and back down the hill through the park. &nbsp;Afterwards we hung out with Patrick and Mindy in their front yard and rapped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 21</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Worked all day and went to the Farmer&rsquo;s Market. &nbsp;Hung out with Otmar and talked more about batteries in reference to the Tesla. &nbsp;Went for a walk around the park with Hb and Nancy B. &nbsp;She told us all about her trip this winter down to Arizona, southern Ca, and Silver City. &nbsp;She has an app that shows her when she is on BLM land. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 22</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Long walk at the end of the day around the park by myself while Hb was home watering the front yard correctly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 23</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pedro picks us up at 9AM for a ride out to Andrea&rsquo;s to pick blueberries. &nbsp;Ali went with us, it was the first time we met him. &nbsp;I picked 2.5 buckets and we took a lot of blueberries home. &nbsp;At the end of the picking I went for a walk across the King&rsquo;s Valley Highway down the river some. &nbsp;Got home and worked the rest of the day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 24</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At 4:30PM we went to the COOP for a block party. &nbsp;Ken was there. &nbsp;We ate lots of samples and then went for a hike up on Fitton Green.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 25</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farmer&rsquo;s Market in the morning, the

Yachats for the Psychic Fair. &nbsp;I walked around and hit a garage sale and got some free seeds along with my purchase of a Canyon Ranch cookbook. &nbsp;We headed over to Cape Perpetua for the first time. &nbsp;We drove to the top of the hill, and hung for awhile up there looking at the ocean. &nbsp;Its certainly a beautiful spot. &nbsp;Back in Waldport for dinner at the bar on the water. &nbsp;We had lunch at the Mexican restaurant just at the southern edge of town which was much, much better. &nbsp;The drive home on Hwy 34 is lovely. &nbsp;Hang with Izzy, Patrick and Mindy after

Credit Union.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 06</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the evening we went over to Coho to hear a long lecture and concert on Didgeridoos.
