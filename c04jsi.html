Driving towards getting Historical Prices into the database.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Tuesday 20</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Re-design of Historical Prices in the database is working. Msft issues $3 special one time dividend.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Wednesday 21</span></p><p class="c1"><span>I am getting historical price data into the database via Hibernate and I am independently getting the data out of the database via JDBC. So the database is an interface, there is no coupling between the software that puts data into the db and software that pulls it out. Same as the fundamental key statistics, the file is the intermediate interface between the (2) programs. The robot writes the key statistics (ks) and the reporting software reads the (ks). So one can use a file structure or relational database as an interface for reading and writing data. Rand&#39;s house for dinner, watched a very marginal movie called Niagra starring Marilyn Monroe. Tessie is out of town in St. Louis and Sima just got back from camp the other day.
