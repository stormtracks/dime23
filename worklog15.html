since that was my core golang model package there was no need to go further afield. &nbsp;But now that etcd is pretty tucked in, I can move on to my next big foray, and I believe bitcoin might be it.

class="c0">So last night we went to Lee Miller&rsquo;s house, Craig and Jackie were there and we had a great evening. &nbsp;We got in the car at 10:22PM. &nbsp;Today I realized several things. &nbsp;That with a bit more effort I can come back up to speed with Angular. &nbsp;It has over 37K hits on Github and the spark behind this is that Kibana 4.0 is out and uses Angular. &nbsp;So like Etcd with Go, I have a model system with Kibana to crank back on the lever of Kibana. &nbsp;Plus the new version uses Express instead of Sinatra for the server, so I am totally back up and running with Node to round out the trio of languages namely {Golang, Node.js, and Ruby}. &nbsp;Also, I decided NOT to work on the Redis Cluster go client, it is just too early. &nbsp;More clients need to get flushed out and someone else will emerge with a Go client for Redis cluster. &nbsp;In the meantime I can study all of the other clients as well. &nbsp;Plus, Gary, the guy behind Redigo doesn&rsquo;t seem that cool, which means working with him would be a pain, and I am not looking for free pains to deal with. &nbsp;So I am off to the races with Angular and Node.js, and will use this as a second jumping off point to look for a job.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">4/1</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Redis 3.0.0 was released today

if I lose my job prior to going to Florida. &nbsp;Until my return from Florida all I am going to focus on besides work at Spinnakr is Raft and Etcd. &nbsp;That is it, nothing else. &nbsp;In March when we get back from Florida then depending on how things go up till that point I can start marketing my Raft and Etcd skill set to find work in that area. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span
