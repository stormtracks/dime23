giant thumb drive. &nbsp;It was my last bout with windows. &nbsp;In fact, now I can throw away, give away that Dell box that sits in my closet. &nbsp;It is the old computer that Hb used after I left for California. &nbsp;In fact, if I want I am thinking about possibly putting Ubuntu on it. &nbsp;But on thinking about it further it is probably not even worth it. &nbsp;Just take it to the computer recycle place across the street from Hb&rsquo;s airconditioning car mechanics.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 14</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hb and I had a nice day.

well as his new development up on the mesa. &nbsp;I then proceeded to walk home via the hoods in that area until I hit the Open Space. &nbsp;In the evening we watched the movie &ldquo;Smoke&rdquo;

We sat at a table at the window and la puerta. &nbsp;The food was real good and we took home a lot. &nbsp;Afterwards Hb went to buy a French Press. &nbsp;The guy in the cooking store was real nice and holds cooking classes. &nbsp;We learned about cook ware and the finer points of cast iron and stainless steel. &nbsp;Then we drove out 180 and took a sharp turn right on the road to the ski basin. &nbsp;We drove back a long way the Natl Forest boundary and saw a house for sale. &nbsp;After buying gas we crossed the tracks and headed back through NAU. &nbsp;It is a nice relatively modern campus. &nbsp;We got back to the hotel and chilled out till check out time at noon. &nbsp;Then we drove through Oak Creek Canyon. &nbsp;Our first stop was at the Overlook --- a fantastic view. &nbsp;We met a Peruvian guy selling long sleeve T shirts that says Sedona, Az. &nbsp;We also met some Canadian guys who live in LA. &nbsp;They were camping out in Sedona. &nbsp;We drove down the switch backs and ate lunch at the National Forest Campground on the right. &nbsp;Its the first one past the fish hatchery. &nbsp;We ate our breakfast and I walked around the camp area while Hb fixed the earring she bought from an Indian lady back at the look out. &nbsp;We arrived at our hotel Sedona Real and I walked up Dry Creek and right on Thunder Mountain. &nbsp;I found a trail head and hiked up. &nbsp;I saw all the way across the valley</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">towards Cottonwood, Jerome on the hill, and Prescott Valley on the other side of the mountains. &nbsp;A bit to the north was the camp site Hb and I camped at in Sedona back in the summer autumn of 2002. &nbsp;Hb arrived after shopping and we did a second round of hiking. &nbsp;She was happy to have found me, Hb loves me. &nbsp;We went back to the hotel and then walked over to a super fantastic restaurant called Thai Spice. &nbsp;I had Miso soup and a cucumber salad on a bed of lettuce. &nbsp;Hb had a beautiful, delicious green curry dish. &nbsp;This was some of the best Thai food I have ever eaten. &nbsp;It was superb. &nbsp;There is no Thai restaurant in all of NM that even comes close.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 04</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I walked up Dry Creek back to the trail head and Hb picked me up at 9:30AM. &nbsp;We went to have breakfast at the Coffee Pot. &nbsp;I had pancakes and Hb had eggs, and sausage, coffee. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the restaurant has gone way down hill. &nbsp;I read the paper during breakfast and enjoyed the ridicule of Rush Limbaugh regarding calling a college student a bad name. &nbsp;We then drove out to Cathedral Rock and climbed to the top. &nbsp;At times it was scary going up but over time we gained more confidence and wellness of being. &nbsp;The way down was easier. &nbsp;We moved on to the river at Oak Creek. &nbsp;We ate some lunch at the parking area and then walked down to the river. &nbsp;As we walked along the river I saw the loop and it was cool. &nbsp;The winter fauna and flora was bland and beautiful along the river bottom along with Sedona. &nbsp;We had a lovely Mexican dinner at Plaza Bonita. &nbsp;I had been at the restaurant before in Prescott I believe a number of years back. &nbsp;Seeing across the valley on my first day in Sedona tied together the whole area. &nbsp;I could see Jerome from Sedona and Sedona from Jerome. &nbsp;This time of year in Sedona is almost perfect as you walk you are neither too hot or too cold.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 05</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I ate breakfast at the hotel and then we went over to the Hyatt parking lot and had breakfast at the Wild Flower Bread Co. &nbsp;We ate here and spent quite a bit of time reading the papers of the day looking over the beautiful red rocks and across the Valley. &nbsp;The morning wind died down and we headed out to the end of Dry Creek Road. &nbsp;After turning right &nbsp;we found our trail head spot. &nbsp;There was a green Forest service truck parked there. &nbsp;Prior to that we had drove to the end of the road and discovered a gated community. We parked our car and headed out on the trail. &nbsp;We knew nothing about this trail. &nbsp;We were looking for the Long Trail but instead settled on this one by shear serendipity. &nbsp;It was an excellent choice. &nbsp;Along the way we met some really nice people. &nbsp;A couple from Pagosa Springs and two girls from California visiting Sedona. &nbsp;The trail was very nice and ended up almost at the beginning of another Trail. &nbsp;If you head up Long Trail and then catch Dead Man&rsquo;s trail on the way back and then catch the trail we were on coming from the other direction you have a nice big loop. &nbsp;We should do this next time. &nbsp;Any way, the trail goes around a large beautiful Sedona style rock structure slash amphitheatre. &nbsp;It was walking along the edge of the rock cliffs of this structure for a long way. &nbsp;The day was perfect and Hb lead us back home. &nbsp;We arrived back at our hotel and then headed out to the shopping area called Tlaquepaque. &nbsp;Named after the place we went to visit in Mexico on our first journey when we stayed at Casa Flores in Guadalajara. &nbsp;Afterwards we had a nice dinner at our favorite Thai place in Sedona. &nbsp;We got to meet the owner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 06</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hb and I had breakfast at the hotel and then we drove home. &nbsp;We arrived back in ABQ at 6PM and went to the SunFlower Market. &nbsp;See the spreadsheet on the details of our mileage home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 07</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First windy day back to work. &nbsp;Just starting to turn the crank. &nbsp;Hb and I did our bills and she went into town for some medical appointments. &nbsp;I did kindling

Security and how it works. &nbsp;I talked to Mom and Dad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 09</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Got out on a walk early and beat the wind. &nbsp;Kind of a cloudy rainy snowy day here today. &nbsp;I arrived back from Argentina one year ago and went to Mom and Dad&rsquo;s house in Florida until March 23. &nbsp;I know this because I renewed my annual cell phone plan yesterday, one day before it was due.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 10</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Very mellow day at home. &nbsp;Allergies are bad and in full bloom. &nbsp;Hb went into town to visit Gabe at the UNM hospital. &nbsp;He is doing better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 11</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Went for a long walk till the end of the paved road in Placitas via the BLM land. &nbsp;This is the place where you make a left turn to go to Pam and James house. &nbsp;Earlier in the day Hb and I had breakfast at the Range. &nbsp;We saw Marcy and Anne there and Anne choked on her food when we walked up to talk to them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today is the beginning of daylight savings time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 12</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today is Hb&rsquo;s birthday, we had a good day. &nbsp;I had a nice long talk with Peter. &nbsp;We are continuing our research topic of &ldquo;listening to the silence&rdquo;. &nbsp;I came up with this concept of doing this on Saturday, two days ago in the mid afternoon as I was transitioning from work to relax and Peter put some words around it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 13</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nice walk on the mesa. &nbsp;The weather is gorgeous. &nbsp;For the first time since late autumn set in. &nbsp;I am wearing shorts. &nbsp;We walked around the block with George and talked about Chaco as a young puppy and his run in

&nbsp;Then we went for a walk in the Bosque. &nbsp;Back to Rand&rsquo;s house and did the tour of the front and back yard. &nbsp;Wilda&rsquo;s house is still for sale. &nbsp;Then I hit SunFlower and Trader Joe&rsquo;s. &nbsp;Got home and went for a long walk up on the mesa. &nbsp;There was a blue truck as I peaked the summit from the valley. &nbsp;As they passed, I walked north towards Santa Fe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 16</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Started working on streaming and found clarinet over the weekend.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 17</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Long walk to the rock structure on the Indian due north of here. &nbsp;I am learning my way around the BLM land. &nbsp;As I climbed to the top I saw the horses and they looked at me and I at them. &nbsp;Got home and buried the horse shit in the back yard in little holes that Hb and I dug.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 18</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Awesome poetry reading by Rich Boucher. &nbsp;Howard McCord was the other poet I loved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday

doing this since last autumn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 22</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Read a Node book by mixu.net that really describes very clearly control flow in Node. &nbsp;Hb went to her monthly moon party and I went for a second walk along the pipeline road and back down Orno Creek. &nbsp;Earlier in the day I met Max who has the horses up on the hill north of here. &nbsp;He retired at age 59. &nbsp;Also, had a call with a company called Klout. &nbsp;Also, got my craigslist engine generating out really nice content based on the reds index.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 23</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pretty good day on the work front as I moved the whole craigslist infrastructure code over to a whole

&nbsp;Nice walk at the end of the day just at sunset. &nbsp;At this time of year, it is cold after the sun sets and so I wear my jacket and blue hat, but also shorts. &nbsp;I got an email from Scott, he is the travails of his comprehensives. &nbsp;I have been trying to get in touch with him for days now, I am glad he emailed me back and told me what was going on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span

class="c1">Friday 06</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Passover at Rand&rsquo;s house with Bruce, Kathy, Jenny, Sima, Dominic, Rand, and Tessie. &nbsp;It was beautiful. &nbsp;Getting together with the family is a lovely thing. &nbsp;Life has its treasures, and for some reason some of them you just simply missed out on. &nbsp;I think as I get older I am starting to realize what they are. &nbsp;In the next life, I will have more of a clue. &nbsp;Muy bien !</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 07</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nancy&rsquo;s house warming party for

Late in the day Hb goes for a bike ride and I go for a walk. &nbsp;First time heading out Cedar Creek and then making the first right turn and heading up the road and continuing on the trail and all the way back around. &nbsp;This is a really nice walk, and one I have never done before. &nbsp;It is amazing that I have lived out here about 10 years and I am STILL going on new walks. &nbsp;Now that says something about the beauty of this place. &nbsp;At the end of the walk I hooked up with George and Chaco and finished out a nice walk with them. &nbsp;In the evening, we watched a nice movie about a princess and her prince who she finds living in a big city. &nbsp;He was the searcher all along but he did not know it. &nbsp;The official name of the movie is called Princess: A Modern Fairy

then west back to Hohokum.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 14</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Never left the house today. &nbsp;My first post to Hacker News in my life on the &ldquo;51 Most Popular Programming Languages on GitHub&rdquo;. &nbsp;I had one comment the first day and now I better understand how HN works. &nbsp;It was a windy day and as the day came to a

class="c1">First weekend in a long time that we stayed home all weekend. &nbsp;We had a fire going all day. &nbsp;David, the heater guy came over in the morning to recommend replacing our hot water heater and also to add water to our boiler. &nbsp;We had a nice chicken dinner and I went for a walk around the block after dinner. &nbsp;We made reservations today for Hb going to Portland. &nbsp;She spoke to Joan and Prashant and they will be around this summer so Hb can go visit them. &nbsp;United&rsquo;s website is cool as it allowed us book a trip from ABQ - DENVER - PORTLAND -

class="c0"><span class="c1">Breakfast with Marcy and Anne at the Tamaya followed by Earth Day at the winery. &nbsp;George was playing with Barb. &nbsp;We sat outside under the peach tree and read the NYTimes and talked to the local folks who came by. &nbsp;Hb left and I watch the band called Sue and then walked home via the deep arroyo next to the winery. &nbsp;Hb had a new moon party in the evening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday 23</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Peter and I have lunch at the Saffron Tiger. &nbsp;I meet him at the merc at 11:30AM and we head into town. &nbsp;Back home via Corrales. &nbsp;Prior to taking a shower I turned off the heat. &nbsp;We should be good to around November 1.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday 24</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Peter left at 11AM and I did some laundry and got back to work. &nbsp;The past two days have been very warm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday 25</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hb and I went for a walk late in the day. &nbsp;Earlier in the day I looked into alternative options for travelers cheques which are being phased out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday 26</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tanner was born today at 12:39 PM weighing in at 7 pounds 11 ounces. &nbsp;I spoke to Luke late in the afternoon and he sounded good. &nbsp;Ashley is doing well tambien. &nbsp;It got rainy and windy and cold late in the day. &nbsp;Also, idcc hits 28 after their earnings release so there is starting to be some potential opportunity there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday 27</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hb and I went for a walk in the morning and then she had a reading with sherry. &nbsp;We had a great lunch of sausages. &nbsp;In the evening we watch &ldquo;The secret of moonacre&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday 28</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Drove into town early and dropped off the computer at the place across the street from Hb&rsquo;s old car repair shop on the corner of Montano and Edith. &nbsp;Then dropped off recycle and went over to my house. &nbsp;Glen and I hung out for awhile and discussed the world situation after a glass of tea. &nbsp;I worked all day on cleaning out my shed. &nbsp;I took everything out of the shed on Arcadian Trail and hosed down the whole shed. &nbsp;I have not done that since before I went to Caltech, and possibly before Diana moved into my house at the end of October 2007. &nbsp;I moved out at that time and moved into Hb&rsquo;s house for the month of November and December 2007. &nbsp;Then we went to Ecuador on January 11, 2008 and Pam Dunbar drove us to the airport. &nbsp;Upon my arrival back from Ecuador on April 1, 2008 I moved into Hb&rsquo;s house and moved out in mid October 2008. &nbsp;So, it is not clear when the shed was last hosed out but if its the summer of 2007 and we are now close to the summer of 2012 then it has been FIVE years since the shed was hosed out properly. &nbsp;Luckily, I was able to take a lot of the stuff across the street to my neighbors. &nbsp;They were happy to have my stuff and I was happy not to have to take stuff over to the Thrift Store. &nbsp;They acted as my Thrift store and I gave them some good stuff. &nbsp;I took many, many big and small boxes to recycle. &nbsp;So, the shed is very cleaned out. &nbsp;At the end of the day I did two more trips to the recycle and then stopped by SunFlower Market to do some shopping before going home. &nbsp;It was a full, interesting day at my house and Glen made my day full and exciting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday 29</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Great day of bike riding with Glen Larson at Diana&rsquo;s house. &nbsp;We rode from his house down to Tingley Park. &nbsp;Got home around 4PM and stopped by the Merc to

&nbsp;Then we went for a walk and had a nice lunch. &nbsp;Sue was here as well. &nbsp;Todo bien. &nbsp;The remainder of the day after everyone left was mellow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thursday 05</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Long talk with Iris and David after a nice morning walk on Jasper. &nbsp;Today was the first &ldquo;autumn&rdquo; day in NM. &nbsp;It was cloudy and chilly all day. &nbsp;Hb and I went for a walk at dusk and it was lovely. &nbsp;Wow, the weather here in NM is really nice when it wants to be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Friday 06</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the day I spoke to Zeke on the phone and agreed to go up to Santa Fe on Tuesday July 10. &nbsp;In the evening I started panicking because the whole concept of going up to Santa Fe multiple days per week does not resonate with me. &nbsp;It was then, as the sun was setting in the west that I started to realize I had to search Craigslist for only Telecommute jobs. &nbsp;Prior to that I was sending out resumes to folks who were not telecommute jobs and that was really not that smart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Saturday 07</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Great day in Santa Fe. &nbsp;It rained pretty much the whole time we were there. &nbsp;We started out at the Farmer&rsquo;s Market and I bought some bread and Hb got her coffee and gluten free pastries. &nbsp;From there we walked around town some. &nbsp;We stopped off at the El Dorado while it was raining and drank some water. &nbsp;We then walked back to the Monroe gallery and they had done a piece on Human Rights recently with the Arab Spring and over the past 50 years. &nbsp;We then had the buffet lunch at the La Fonda and then came home. &nbsp;It rained the whole way home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sunday 08</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I got up early in the morning and wrote a note to Zeke saying I was not interested in a telecommute job but I did not send it. &nbsp;For some reason, it is important that I go up to Santa Fe on the train on Tuesday and meet with him. &nbsp;Hb and I had lunch at the Tamaya and then hung out at the pool all afternoon. &nbsp;I went down the slide and had a blast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Monday 09</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">9am call with Lauren in Costa Rica followed by some work on Ruby.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tuesday 10</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Santa Fe all day talking to Zeke, Cliff, and Paul at JackRabbit Systems. &nbsp;Finished the meeting after lunch at Il Vicinio and walked around town. &nbsp;It was raining at first so I hung out in the El Dorado. &nbsp;Michele and I hung out there in Saturday as well. &nbsp;The hotel is dead with not a soul. &nbsp;Walked through the NM capitol building. &nbsp;Amazing place, not one person either. &nbsp;Not one. &nbsp;WOW. &nbsp; Then over to Dave&rsquo;s old house. &nbsp;Can not even remember who lived there with him. &nbsp;Then back to the rail yard and met a woman from the ACLU raising money. &nbsp;The hopped on the train for the ride back to ABQ. &nbsp;It was my first time on the train today and I loved it. &nbsp;When I got home at around 6PM, I sent off my rejection of Zeke&rsquo;s offer and then went for a long walk up on the mesa taking it all in and praying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Wednesday 11</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The summer weather has turned absolutely magnificent. &nbsp;We will have another hot spell. &nbsp;But the worst of it is over and now we have to appreciate this gorgeous weather. &nbsp;Long talk today with Tim Frazer at FoodyDirect. &nbsp;This guy is cool. &nbsp;Call him later and touch base with him. &nbsp;Went for a walk after speaking to him at noon. &nbsp;I saw Bill Patterson and we wrapped for a second. &nbsp;Then out into the open space. &nbsp;It was another cloudy day in central NM.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thursday 12</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Today is Scott&rsquo;s birthday. &nbsp;I had a call with Michael who is the co-founder of Spinnakr. &nbsp;This was my first call ever talking to Michael. &nbsp;After his call I went for a walk up on the north mesa. &nbsp;It rained very hard at dinner time. &nbsp;Hb was driving home, she is lucky she made it. &nbsp;It is the hardest rain I have seen since being back from BA.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Friday 13</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After a beautiful rain last night I worked outside this morning pulling some weeds. &nbsp;At 5PM we went over to the library for Jade&rsquo;s Art opening. &nbsp;Tom and she had just got back from Mexico City. &nbsp;It was her first time back to her mother country in 12 years. &nbsp;Michele and I met Jade back in 2006 when she was a waitress at the Range. &nbsp;Tom is partners with Neal Copperman and together they do Globalquerque.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Saturday 14</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Went up to Santa Fe and hit the farmer&rsquo;s market. &nbsp;Then we went to Hb&rsquo;s new gluten free bakery on the corner of Cerillos and San Felipe. &nbsp;Then we had lunch at Piccolinos which was recommended by Zeke at JackRabbit Systems. &nbsp;It was our first time there and we had a really nice salad. &nbsp;Afterwards we headed over to Scott&rsquo;s house for his birthday which was two days ago. &nbsp;We got there around 2PM and no one showed up till 6PM. &nbsp;Scott and I went for a short walk with the talk and he and I partied a bit as well. &nbsp;The people who came were all from France and the core person was Katherine who is friends with Kathy. &nbsp;One of the folks there by the name of Michael was very interesting. &nbsp;He told me about living in England during the time of Maggie Thatcher and what it was like. &nbsp;It was in reference to me telling him that I saw the movie Iron Lady.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sunday 15</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lavender festival with Nancy, Angie, Rand and Tessie. &nbsp;We met for breakfast at the new restaurant Farm Table there on 4th Street. &nbsp;They have a farm behind the restaurant. &nbsp;It was an absolutely perfect morning and the sun was shaded at our table. &nbsp;Afterwards we went and parked at Sima&rsquo;s elementary school and Nancy and Angie walked with us over to the festival. &nbsp;It was not as good as the old Lavender festivals on the Los Poblanos farm, but it was nice. &nbsp;Afterwards we sat inside the community garden on some little benches at the Open Space near Rand&rsquo;s house.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Monday 16</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Had a talk with the Spinnakr folks, spoke to Adam and Michael was on the line.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tuesday

was exactly two weeks ago today that I had my first call with Michael at Spinnakr. &nbsp;And coincidentally, it was also on that day that we got a GIANT first rain. &nbsp;So the rains and my life are very much in sync. &nbsp;Strange, but good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Friday 27</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Paperwork stuff for Spinnakr. &nbsp;Also, spoke to Mom on her

Market to pick up some minor food.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tuesday 18</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Talked to Mom and Dad. &nbsp;Mother has to still deal with her cataract surgery part II.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Wednesday 19</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Walk in the morning and water outside. &nbsp;Made some pear applesauce. &nbsp;In the evening Hb went to belly dancing and I finished stacking up the cord of wood along with moving the wood chips from the stack over to the compost pile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thursday 20</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Andy arrived mid afternoon and we hung out and chatted for awhile. &nbsp;Then I did some work and he took a nap. &nbsp;I made a nice dinner of cucumber salad. &nbsp;We had tons of cucumbers from the Farmer&rsquo;s Market a couple of weeks back. &nbsp;After dinner Andy, Hb and I went for a walk around the block. &nbsp;Andy and I did a second loop. &nbsp;Afterwards we were hanging out at the end of the driveway shooting the shit when a sheriff drove by. &nbsp;I can count on my one finger how many times that has happened. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t stop to ask us any questions but it was kind of bizarre. &nbsp;We thought it would probably have been Ty and Barb.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Friday 21</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Worked all day and then went to Globalquerque with Hb and Andy. &nbsp;Met Rand for dinner. &nbsp;Saw Seth Hoffman and some other folks from Nahalat Shalom and also Philip Clark and his girlfriend Pam.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Saturday 22</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I walked at least 7 miles today. &nbsp;Breakfast at the Range with Andy after the Flea Market. &nbsp;Then Hb dropped me off and at the &ldquo;top of the hill&rdquo; and I walked for the first time on the other side of the winery up against the Overlook hillside. &nbsp;Very interesting topography. &nbsp;I had to skirt around the house at the mouth of the canyon. &nbsp;Then continued to walk till dusk from 2PM.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sunday 23</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Great day in Santa Fe at the Renaissance Fair at Las Golindrinas. &nbsp;Superb autumn day hanging out in La Cienega. &nbsp;It was the perfect spot, with good food, drink, and people. &nbsp;One of our best days of the year.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Monday 24</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Andy goes up to Santa Fe to visit Arturo. &nbsp;We go for a walk around the block twice after dark.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tuesday 25</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Andy leaves after breakfast. &nbsp;We got some rain today. &nbsp;I did my laundry. Late in the day around early evening I dive back into Biology. &nbsp;I clearly have not thought or looked at this stuff since I started working at Spinnakr way back on July 30. &nbsp;This is VERY good news to be back into this stuff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Wednesday 26</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Post office in the early afternoon to mail off a health insurance form for Spinnakr. &nbsp;Hb worked this afternoon. &nbsp;Set up my account on NCBI PubMed. &nbsp;This is great news, as I am back into the Biology realm. &nbsp;Now that winter is coming on I need more stuff to do indoors and Biology is a great outlet for intellectual curiosities. &nbsp;Hb and I went for a walk around the block in the evening. &nbsp;Earlier in the day we made some chicken soup. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thursday 27</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Two walks today. &nbsp;One prior to speaking to Michael at 9AM. &nbsp;I walked around the block twice. &nbsp;Then after his call I went for my north mesa walk. &nbsp;Today I made some beet greens along with beet drink and apples which are left over from when Rand and I picked them at the Open Space on Rio Grande and Alameda a couple of weeks back Rand and I had lunch at the Flying Star and then we went to the Open Space. &nbsp;I had a nice talk with Dad in the mid afternoon and then mother called later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Friday 28</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Luke&rsquo;s birthday was not a great day. &nbsp;Hb and I had a huge blowout prior to her going to Jan&rsquo;s for her first meeting. &nbsp;I made a banana bread with caramelized brown sugar. &nbsp;I need to buy more brown sugar for future banana breads. &nbsp;Much more hearty than white sugar. &nbsp;Was going to go for a walk in the evening but we got a giant well deserved rain storm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Saturday 29</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Fall Harvest

cafe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thursday 04</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hb dropped me off and I went for a walk up the big hill toward the Overlook. &nbsp;It was my first time walking up that way from that direction where Hb dropped me off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Friday 05</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Got my teeth cleaned. &nbsp;Went into

more. &nbsp;Hb and I watched a movie in the evening on Australia.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sunday 07</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">La Casa de Bernarda Alba at the NHCC. &nbsp;We hung out earlier on the patio there, it was a gorgeous sunny autumn day. &nbsp;We had Flashbacks to Globalquerque a few weeks back when it was a glorious night full of people. &nbsp;Autumn is lovely. &nbsp;The play was very intense and mostly in Spanish so Hb had a hard time grokking the concepts of the play which is frustrating. &nbsp;Earlier in the day I talked to Brian Wehrung for about 90 minutes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Monday 08</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Great late afternoon apple picking at Mary&rsquo;s house. &nbsp;I met her grandson John, John&rsquo;s son, and his fiance. &nbsp;They are getting next year October 5.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hb and I came home and went for a walk. &nbsp;I then proceeded to make some more

at the Santuario. &nbsp;It was a cloudy day but no rain on the drive. &nbsp;It rained early in the morning at home. &nbsp;Lunch in Taos at the Way Back Pizza. &nbsp;We had a nice gluten free crust. &nbsp;We walked around town in the late afternoon. &nbsp;It was raining here and there but did not get in the way of our walk. &nbsp;We had dinner at the Taos Inn bar and sat by the window. &nbsp;Hb had a chile relleno and a margarita and I had chips. &nbsp;We watched a show in the evening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Saturday 13</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the early morning I headed out Salazar road and then back via Valverde and ended up at the Farmer&rsquo;s market. &nbsp;It was a lovely cloudy day and we had a nice breakfast at Casa Benavides. &nbsp;Then we walked over to the Farmer&rsquo;s market and then walked around Valverde and down into the Sunset Park and over to Orinda. &nbsp;It was cold down in the valley near Orinda. &nbsp;Then we went back

14</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Drove to El Rito via the Pilar River crossing. &nbsp;Gorgeous morning driving across the bridge at Pilar and up the side of the canyon. &nbsp;Once we hit the top we had paved road. &nbsp;Gorgeous day in El Rito. &nbsp;My first time there. &nbsp;Met some real nice folks at their galleries. &nbsp;One guy we met pulled a gun on us as a joke, but I didn&rsquo;t think it was too funny. &nbsp; Drove home and had dinner in Santa Fe at Whole Foods. &nbsp;Home at dark, with just enough light to bring our stuff inside. &nbsp;Then we went for a walk around the block and ended the walk with glorious stars.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Monday 15</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">First day back to work was a disaster. &nbsp;I took two naps and got nothing done. &nbsp;Went to bed real early and slept all night. &nbsp;Spoke to Peter earlier in the day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tuesday 16</span></p><p

&nbsp;Earlier in the morning I had a 90 minute call with Scott Friedman. &nbsp;He has moved on from Seegrid and wants to start checking things off his bucket list. &nbsp;So I was able to set up an appt to speak with him when I get home about his new projects.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Friday 19</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Mellow day at home. &nbsp;Hb and I went for a walk just after dusk with a new moon that was bright and shiny. &nbsp;Then I did a second loop and saw Cherie. &nbsp;George came home from the hospital on Wednesday and she was pretty worn out and

decided to skip.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tuesday 23</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hb and I went for a walk at the end of the day and I read Pagina12 prior to going to sleep. &nbsp;Its a great paper with the right slant. &nbsp;And now that Google translate easily shows me the whole article in English with the Spanish overlay my life and my ability to learn Spanish

Pam&rsquo;s ashes site. &nbsp;James and I took in the views, the trees, and the glory of being alive. &nbsp;A good TIME was had by all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Monday 03</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hb and I went for a walk at the end of the day just as the last light set in the west. &nbsp;Lots of laundry, and made bed after Peter left yesterday.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tuesday 04</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">John Zeuli and I had a nice walk off our main spot. &nbsp;It is the first time I had seen him since prior to going home to Pittsburgh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Wednesday 05</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Cleaned house in the morning. &nbsp;Hb and I did a big walk up on the north mesa. &nbsp;Gorgeous day in the low 60&rsquo;s. &nbsp;We saw Bill Patterson and Nathan on our walk. &nbsp;Hb had a reading with Sherry at 4PM.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thursday 06</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Mellow day, talked to Peter in the morning briefly about how to burn a CD in the new ITunes 11.0.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Friday 07</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Its nice to work and then have the weekend off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Saturday 08</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hit the shed at Diana&rsquo;s house to get some winter clothes and gear. &nbsp;Picked up some old pants etc... &nbsp;Hb and I went on the usual food shopping circuit. &nbsp;It was a gorgeous winter day in central NM. &nbsp;Hanging out at the shed as always is a mixed blessing. &nbsp;I gave Hb her Christmas present as well and we did the money circuit too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sunday 09</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The clouds rolled in the late morning as we drove to the South Valley for Mary Sharp-Davis&rsquo;s annual Christmas bash and Holiday Fair. &nbsp;Judith and Diana were there selling their wares and I ate two bowls of posole and some sweets. &nbsp;I went for a walk along the ditch and the dogs were barking ferociously. &nbsp;The South Valley is still rough. &nbsp;We came home and watched the movie Hugo, a classic by all accounts. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Monday 10</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Coldest day of the year so far. &nbsp;In fact, I never left the house except to take out the compost late in the day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tuesday 11</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Went to the library in the afternoon to activate my cell phone with Google voice. &nbsp;Another day without walking. &nbsp;I had plans to do it in the evening but then I got sidetracked with work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Wednesday 12</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Big walk up on the north mesa to the end of Las Huertas and back. &nbsp;Saw Tony driving along the way. &nbsp;Then got back and went for a walk around the hill block with Greg Leichner. &nbsp;We had a nice conversation and it was fun hanging out with Lalo. &nbsp;I learned also that Lalo&rsquo;s sister Ruby is now in heaven.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thursday 13</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hb goes to Thomas and drops me off at my old spot just past the library. &nbsp;I walked home. &nbsp;It was a gorgeous day a bit before Christmas. &nbsp;Got home and talked to Sharon, Tom, and Ines who were out in South Pasadena celebrating Tom&rsquo;s birthday of 67. &nbsp;Max Levchin is named to Yahoo&rsquo;s Board today. &nbsp;Stock still under $20.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Friday 14</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A rainy morning and water is falling from the sky. &nbsp;It was a blustery day. &nbsp;Hb and I sat by the fire all day while I worked and Hb watched sort of two movies. &nbsp;One with Ben Kingsley and Penelope Cruz about a man who could not make a commitment, the name of the movie was Elegy. &nbsp;It was a good one. &nbsp;Neither one of us left the house all day except for me to take out the compost and gather up some wood. &nbsp;Also, at the very end of the day I got my first official email from Greg Leichner about a tragedy where 26 people including 20 school children were killed at an Elementary school in Connecticut.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Saturday 15</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Started out the day at Walmart, then on to a hike on the Bosque on the border of Corralles and Rio Rancho. &nbsp;This was the first time for me walking down on the bosque in that area. &nbsp;Then on to SunFlower Market, Trader Joe&rsquo;s and then home. &nbsp;Hb worked today. &nbsp;It was a cloudy snow like day. &nbsp;It was cold, but not too cold to be outside. &nbsp;Yesterday, was too cold to go outside, and I worked all day and did not go out for a walk. &nbsp;Hb stayed home all day yesterday as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sunday 16</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We awake to our first snowfall. &nbsp;Hb goes to work, and John and I decide to get together another day. &nbsp;We were contemplating getting together today but will wait till later in the week. &nbsp;I begin reading Bless Me Ultima.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I discovered it yesterday at the library. &nbsp;The books is signed by Rudolfo Anaya. &nbsp;I saw the movie back on November 11. &nbsp;It was the day after returning to NM from my journey to Pittsburgh. &nbsp;I saw the movie with Hb&rsquo;s sister Pat, and her friends from Ca. and Hobbs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Monday 17</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Found an interesting online book called &ldquo;Essential Guide To Spanish Reading 2012&rdquo;. &nbsp;It lists all of the classic books that young adults should read. &nbsp;On page 11 of this guide it states that there are more Spanish speaking people in the US than there are spanish speakers in Spain. &nbsp;In other words, the current population of Spain is around 47 million people, and mas o menos thats how many spanish speakers there are in the US. &nbsp;This statistic alone is fascinating, but what is even more fascinating is that according to Wikipedia Spanish is the primary language spoken at home by almost 37 million people aged five or older, a figure more than double that of 1990.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tuesday 18</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Nice long walk on the north mesa. &nbsp;Ran into the guy working on the BLM fence. &nbsp;He and his younger partner were mending the fence where the horses had crashed down. &nbsp;I spoke to him for about 20 minutes about the horse situation and what its like to work for the BLM.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Wednesday 19</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Long talk with Peter in the evening. &nbsp;It was a snowy, cloudy day today so I never left the house except to take out the compost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thursday 20</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Friday 21</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hb and I went into town and had breakfast at the Flying Star. &nbsp;Then we went shopping. &nbsp;We went to Keller&rsquo;s to pick up a turkey. &nbsp;At 6:30PM we met John and Ginny at the church for the 15th annual Solstice poetry reading. &nbsp;We also met John, who plays in George&rsquo;s band. &nbsp;He is a nice guy, it is the first time I had met him. &nbsp;He is kind of in charge of organizing the poetry event. &nbsp;Jim Fish read as well. &nbsp;We hung out at the church and were the last ones to leave. &nbsp;Michael Crowfoot did some throat singing to start off the show.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Saturday 22</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Andy arrives just after dark. &nbsp;Earlier in the day we went to a moving sale. &nbsp;The woman was moving to Thailand permanently and was taking 66 chickens. &nbsp;Hb bought another table cloth like the one we had for $10. &nbsp;In the mid afternoon we went for a nice walk out to the end of the road.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sunday 23</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Big Christmas dinner two days early. &nbsp;Cook all day and have Rand for dinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Monday 24</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I hang out at home. &nbsp;Andy goes to a movie with Rand and Hb works. &nbsp;In the evening we go to Diana&rsquo;s for dinner with Glen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tuesday 25</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I hang out at home and Hb and Andy go into town to a movie and to Jason&rsquo;s house. &nbsp;Great walk at the end of the day. &nbsp;Headed up onto north mesa via hill just east of Bill Patterson&rsquo;s house. &nbsp;It was a different way than I usually go up there and it added some specter to the dimension.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Wednesday 26</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">John called me early in the morning and we met at the Placitas Cafe for coffee. &nbsp;We then went for a nice walk down the arroyo from there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thursday 27</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Friday 28</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hb and I went to see the movie &ldquo;The Life of Pi&rsquo;, then we went to dinner at Scalo and sat upstairs at a nice table. &nbsp;Then we went to the Apple store to buy an IPhone. &nbsp;Jason&rsquo;s baby Autumn was born this evening at about 10PM. &nbsp;She has the same birth date as Luke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Saturday 29</span></p><p class="c0"><span

class="c2">Sunday 30</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Went into town to visit Autumn, Jason&rsquo;s new baby at their house. &nbsp;Then we went food shopping. &nbsp;We bought them a new heater as a baby warming gift at Costco. &nbsp;Then we stopped by the Vitamin Cottage and SunFlower Market. &nbsp;We met Jason at Walmart and gave him his salmon and heater.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Monday 31</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Woke up to a nice light dusting of snow. &nbsp;Talked to Peter Day for a while, we had a nice talk. &nbsp;In the afternoon I talked to Mom. &nbsp;She had a hole-in-one a couple of days back on a par 3. &nbsp;Fire at night as we celebrated our New Year&rsquo;s Eve at home by the fire.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span
