Independence from Britian along with the split of Pakistan and India. &nbsp;Beautiful potluck at Bob and Heidi&#39;s with the hood including Jan and Boyd, Doug and Jamie, Steve, Hb and I and Bob and Heidi. &nbsp;Heidi made a turkey, Jan brought brownies, Steve bought a salad from his garden, Doug and Jamie brought winter squash and the day was lovely. &nbsp;It was slightly warm and sunny around 2PM when we gathered. &nbsp;Earlier Phoenix and Naj stopped by with Buddy and we hung outside for a bit and then I walked them up Ryan to Alexander.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Walked over to Kerstin&#39;s to get bread then over to Angelica&#39;s to give her back a book. &nbsp;She had given the book to us as a gift, but there was another outstanding book which Hb found and we returned it to her in the evening on our way to the Oddfellows Meeting. &nbsp;We paid our dues of $88 and ate some food after the meeting. &nbsp;Earlier in the day I moved some dirt from the pile to the backyard. &nbsp;It was my first time moving dirt this year. &nbsp;Also cleaned up the side yard behind the fence next to the Doug Fir. &nbsp;It was my first time cleaning up next to the Doug Fir; hopefully more cleanup is in the works.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday 03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So in the past couple of days, for the first time ever, I have started to clean up the east woods. &nbsp;I started hacking at the Doug Fir and cleared to the fence due west. &nbsp;Now I have a straight path and I can start to trim around there. &nbsp;I have a starting point in which to migrate. &nbsp;So today was another gorgeous sunny day. &nbsp;Its the second one in about 5 days. &nbsp;Sunny, clear, and slightly warm. &nbsp;Lovely...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Up early went to the dentist to have Jenny clean my teeth. &nbsp;Came home

and Hb around the park. &nbsp;We saw Phoenix playing frisbee golf and so the 3 of us went for a very nice walk. &nbsp;Earlier on I had a long talk with John Zeuli about the illusion of money and also stopping yourself from sending out possibly damaging to oneself emails. &nbsp;On the walk with Phoenix he taught me about </span><span class="c5 c2"><a class="c4"

class="c0">Saturday 06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Super fantastic day in Lebanon and Brownsville. &nbsp;Started out in the park just north of town on the Santiam. &nbsp;Then very nice lunch for the first time at our Thai place in Lebanon. &nbsp;Then ran by Walmart for soap and ended up the day at a Gluten Free Bakery in Brownsville. &nbsp;The sun shone the whole day, and we were happy in Oregon in January.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hb went to the coast to spend the night with Bob and Peggy. &nbsp;In the afternoon I went to TMobile and Winco. &nbsp;Then went for a nice walk starting at Aspen off Walnut. &nbsp;Caught the sunset on the 3 sisters with another couple walking by. &nbsp;It was just at sunset that we saw them. &nbsp;Quite magnificent. &nbsp;Afterwards I went to the North COOP, then TJ&#39;s and the Natural Grocers. &nbsp;Got home after dark and made some liver and onions. &nbsp;Topped the evening off with a long talk with Pedro.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Hb got home from Yachats and we went to the

class="c0">&nbsp;talk about robots. &nbsp;We went for a walk at home around the block afterwards.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the afternoon I moved some more dirt and spoke to Boyd about his motivating me to do a New Year&#39;s resolution which was to do my mantras daily. &nbsp;Afterwards Hb and I went for a walk around the Goodnight block. &nbsp;It was our first time on the wetland paved trail this year. &nbsp;We walked through the trailer park over to WL.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday 10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Went to the spring creek open house and saw Laura from Gathering Together, Eric Dickey who I met at Beth&#39;s party and we met our neighbor Linda Richards who lives across from Gwendolyn. &nbsp;Then we went to a talk on the Kayapo by Barbara Zimmerman. &nbsp;It was an excellent talk about whats going on in Brazil in an area larger than Costa Rica.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Annual OSU Community Artist Exhibit at LaSells. &nbsp;Hb bought an eclipse photo. &nbsp;Ed Ray was there. &nbsp;It was a slightly rainy night, but we had a good time and the salmon and other food was more yummy than usual. &nbsp;It was a rainy day today, but didn&#39;t get in our way. &nbsp;Hb went with Sarah over to Bill Koch&#39;s to look at his passed on wifes loom. &nbsp;Late in the evening I spoke with David for our 2 - 3 times per year talk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday 12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hb and I drove downtown and she went for her massage with Lawrence and I went for a walk and stopped by the Apple store to get some info on used computers and new ones. &nbsp;Then over to the library for the Corvallis Sustainability Annual meeting. &nbsp;I got to the library early and hung out with Ken, got some lunch and spoke to Lee and Tim. &nbsp;It was a good meeting. &nbsp;Hb arrived pretty soon. &nbsp;Afterwards we hung out and met some new folks. &nbsp;Late in the day I went for a walk around the park. &nbsp;It was a pretty warm cloudy winter day in Corvallis and my walk was nice. &nbsp;I had brussel sprouts for dinner. &nbsp;It was our last batch of brussel sprouts till next year from TJ&#39;s.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday 13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Started the day off in Lebanon at the Safeway where Hb bought some coffee. &nbsp;We then drove over to a rock shop on the way to Waterloo. &nbsp;In Waterloo we met Jesus Christ after walking to the end of the park and he came out of the woods. &nbsp;His real name was Raymond and he had on a talit. &nbsp;He then read us the gospel for at least one hour and by the time he was done I was born again. &nbsp;Afterwards, we went into Lebanon and had our yummy Thai food at the best Thai restaurant in Lebanon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peter came over for dinner. &nbsp;Earlier in the day I got leaves from Jason&#39;s house and put some of his leaves in his chicken coop. &nbsp;Afterwards Hb and I went for a walk around the block. &nbsp;Peter is going down to Ojai on Saturday morning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">One of the best speeches I have ever seen on MLK Day at OSU by </span><span class="c5 c2"><a class="c4"

a way I am not usually moved by a public speech. &nbsp;Afterwards Hb and I participated in the Peace march over to Monroe and then we walked downtown and back to the COOP where we had lunch, talked to Ken for awhile and then had a nice chat with Jim prior to departure. &nbsp;The weather was very cooperative and it only rained at the very end of our journey.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Odd Fellows meeting with the grand master of Oregon Gary Kniss. &nbsp;We had a dinner at 5:30PM followed by our meeting followed by doing the dishes. &nbsp;Earlier in the day I moved dirt from the pile to the back yard. &nbsp;It was another gorgeous sunny afternoon in mid January and I was happy to be outside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday 17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hb and I walked downtown and stopped off at the COOP. &nbsp;From there we walked to Laughing Planet Cafe where I got some black beans and tortillas. &nbsp;We took the bus home. &nbsp;It was a warm, cloudy, balmy mid January day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It rained most of the day and I stayed home until 6:30PM when we walked over to Wil and Kathy&#39;s house to celebrate Wil&#39;s 68th birthday. &nbsp;He is about 2 months older than Hb. &nbsp;Diana, Gloria, Jane Kaufman and Anya were there to help us celebrate. &nbsp;Kathy made yummy gluten free chocolate cake with all sorts of gorgeous extra toppings. &nbsp;It was a lovely evening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday 19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hb and I went for a walk around the park. &nbsp;Out there it rained briefly, and then we met some folks who had moved here from Pa. &nbsp;They had their dogs with them. &nbsp;In the late afternoon Hb had the group from last night over for a Tom Kenyon Kirtan session.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday 20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Grant Ruiz and Berto Boyd at the Corvallis library. &nbsp;Afterwards Hb and I had dinner at Del Alma. &nbsp;We hadn&#39;t been there in a long time and the meal, evening and atmosphere was an appropriate ending to an interesting day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Went out on a walk and saw Owen Dell. &nbsp;Hb went to lunch with Bob and Peggy and then on to her group. &nbsp;My walk in the morning in the rain was lovely. &nbsp;Long and around WL, stopped by an open house on the river for 525K then through the entire park and back around. &nbsp;Late in the day I was going to go on a short walk but ran into phoenix on alexander and so we did the interior loop for the first time all around. &nbsp;phoenix told me about the mind being a tool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Left the house around 11AM and got to Portland around 1PM. &nbsp;We had lunch at the Thai restaurant across the street from the Grant Park New Season&#39;s. &nbsp;Afterward we hung out in Season&#39;s for a bit and then went on to the Red Lion. &nbsp;We unloaded our stuff and took the car over to the Holiday Inn and then walked back to the Red Lion. &nbsp;We went for a walk, then I kept walking for about another 30 minutes. &nbsp;We got a free room which was cool. &nbsp;We have stayed at the Red Lion at least once per year since 2013 meaning this is our sixth year there. &nbsp;Pretty hard to believe. &nbsp;We went to bed pretty late and I am pretty sure I hardly slept at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Up at 3AM, out the door at 3:30AM and got right on the shuttle. &nbsp;Had some eggs for breakfast at our usual spot at the airport along with a banana and the cereal I made yesterday. &nbsp;Leg 1 was nice and got to see all of the snow on the front range. &nbsp;Leg 2 was nice from Denver to Milwaukee as I sat next to a doctor whose name was Mike and he was into skiing at Vail. &nbsp;Leg 3 was great as I had 3 seats to myself. &nbsp;Arrived right on time at 6:30PM. &nbsp;Had a nice meal at Jason&#39;s. &nbsp;The folks place is lovely, as per usual.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday 24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gorgeous day in Florida ! &nbsp;Got up to sunshine and warm. &nbsp;Lovely. &nbsp;Dad and I went to Costco in the morning. &nbsp;Mother and I went to WholeFoods in the afternoon. &nbsp;I did 3 loops around the Master&#39;s and at dark a short walk on the Golf course for the first time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mom and Dad went to workout and I stayed at home. &nbsp;It was nice being in a quiet place. &nbsp;In the afternoon Dad and I went over to Publix to get some food and then he dropped me off at the corner of Williams and 41. &nbsp;I walked home and then my book Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. &nbsp;The day was warm and windy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday 26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mother and I headed over to Walgreens on Williams and then I walked back from the gate. &nbsp;She went to play Maj and Dad and I hung out, went over the Providence Point paper work and then we went for a bike ride and then hung out at the local pool. &nbsp;We had a nice afternoon and it was sunny and windy. &nbsp;In the evening we went to the River&#39;s Club and I had chopped steak which was yummy with mashed potatoes, onions, gravy and green beans. &nbsp;Hb would have loved this meal too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday 27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Headed out early down south. &nbsp;We dropped Mom off at the beauty shop and Dad and I went to the Farmer&#39;s market. &nbsp;As I told bina in an email later in the day there was no organic. &nbsp;Afterwards we hung out for awhile and waited for Mom to finish up. &nbsp;The day was mild, not too windy. &nbsp;I don&#39;t like Florida. &nbsp;But I do like the weather. &nbsp;A mixed blessing to say the least. &nbsp; Late in the day I did the first walk to the end of the road where the nature trail kicks in. &nbsp;It could not have been a nicer, quiet evening. &nbsp;I am pretty much at peace here and settled in after being here now for 4 full days.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We went to Bravo in the evening for dinner. &nbsp;It rained a bit on the way home. &nbsp;When I woke up I went for my first early morning walk. &nbsp;Later in the day I spoke with Pedro for the first time since he landed in Ojai. &nbsp;He seems to be having a good time down there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The day started out raining but by the time light was upon us the day yielded dry. &nbsp;I stayed home all day and then went out about 4:30PM for my normal walk to the beginning of the nature trail.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Went to buy pants at the outlet stores. &nbsp;Dad went to Costco and Mother and I bought 2 pair of pants. &nbsp;Afterwards we went to Publix and then I went for my walk before dusk. &nbsp;I walked to the Nature Trail and returned home. &nbsp;In the evening, I had the rare occasion to watch President Trumps first State of the Union. &nbsp;I would never actually do this but being in Florida with my parents presented me with the opportunity. &nbsp;Hb flew from Denver to Albuquerque today for part II of her journey. &nbsp;She will spend the second week at Judith&#39;s house as Diana is visting from Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday 31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the morning we had a conference call with Grant Street. &nbsp;In the afternoon Dad and I went for a bike ride and then I rode further over to West Bay. &nbsp;It was my first time on a bike this year, and my first time, needless to say on a bike in Florida. &nbsp;Mother borrowed a bike from our up stairs neighbor and its a nice cruiser. &nbsp;We had dinner with Mort and Myra at the River&#39;s Club. &nbsp;Mort told me he has Parkinson&#39;s disease, but he appears to be doing well. &nbsp;Upon coming home I went for a short walk. &nbsp;The weather and atmosphere in Florida this time of year is lovely.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">February 2018</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gorgeous perfect weather day in Fl. &nbsp;At 4PM I went out for my walk. &nbsp;Hit the nature trail, and then the dock where I layed down, took a nap, and watched the boats go by. &nbsp;Afterwards I stopped by the bar to get a drink of water / no ice and lime. &nbsp;I carried this cup back towards home and basked in the late afternoon sunset. &nbsp;Dad made a fantastic meat loaf for dinner and I made yellow zuchinni with mushrooms. &nbsp;My dad is one hell of a cook. &nbsp;He always liked to cook, but in his later years he has developed somewhat of a chef quality to himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday 02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Another beautiful day in paradise. &nbsp;Dad and I cleaned the house in the morning while mother went food shopping.

no questions asked. &nbsp;It equates to my fascination with AI back in Boston when I was going to MIT and hanging out at Thinking Machines with Marvin Minsky. &nbsp;Today is one of the most important days of my life. &nbsp;It finally solidifies for me the metaphor of what life is, where I came from, and the possible outcomes for the future of humanity. &nbsp;From this day forward, I will never ever be the same. &nbsp;I am now an enlightedned individual. &nbsp;It is no longer necessary to question where I came from or the purpose of life. &nbsp;This concept answers all of those questions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The past 2 days have been our first real winter type days with snow showers here and there. &nbsp;In the afternoon I walked over to the COOP and hung out with James Rodell, Jim Hagan, and Bob. &nbsp;They are good guys. &nbsp;Over the past couple of months I have gotten to know Jim better. &nbsp;We first met him over a year ago at the potluck at Kent&#39;s music studio downtown. &nbsp;Jim is friends with Wil and Kathy. &nbsp;Hb went to a movie in the evening at LaSells and Jim was there with Wil and Kathy. &nbsp;So she had a good time at the movie on Coral Reefs as part of the OSU 150 Sea Grant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday 21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Up at 6AM. &nbsp;Left the house around 8:30AM. &nbsp;Got to our favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix around 1PM. &nbsp;Had a yummy lunch of tortillas and fajitas with their own salsa bar which I love. &nbsp;From there we went into Ashland. &nbsp;Stopped the COOP to buy black beans and quinoa, then on to Shop and Kart to buy Gluten Free Oats. &nbsp;Took the back road to Mt. Shasta as we always do. &nbsp;Walked around the neighborhoods of town at dusk. &nbsp;Its a nice cute town. &nbsp;It was our first time ever spending the night here and walking around the hoods. &nbsp;At the end of the evening we stopped by the coop for some rice and beans. &nbsp;A good day was had by all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Woke up to some snow on the ground and a winter wonderland. &nbsp;We knew it was going to snow but they were not predicting bad weather, just a dusting. &nbsp;We had a nice breakfast next door at the pastry shop. &nbsp;We had breakfast here last time we were in town and liked it. &nbsp;Afterwards we went for a walk around the hotel and on the road out to McCloud afterwards we drove to Redding. &nbsp;The drive was mellow and nice. &nbsp;We arrived and checked into our hotel and then went and had a nice Thai meal for lunch. &nbsp;Afterwards we went to the Sundial Park and then a long walk along the river. &nbsp;Hb climbed a hill and to everyone&#39;s surprise bolted up to the top. &nbsp;A few college aged kids asked her if she needed help getting up there. &nbsp;Afterwards we cruised around Redding and checked out the town to the west to Shasta and then a bit south and then back east. &nbsp;We had our free dinner of soup and salad. &nbsp;A beautiful day was had by all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday 23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Awesome drive from here. &nbsp;We stopped by a Sacramento River park, but it wasn&#39;t very good and the road was kind of crowded with cars. &nbsp;We had lunch in Chico at our favorite Indian restaurant then out Hwy 32 and down Hwy 45 all the way to Colusa then continued to Knight&#39;s Landing and then due south to I5. &nbsp;We went out to an early dinner with Pat to a nice new Mexican restaurant. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday 24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leave Pat&#39;s house at 9AM. &nbsp;Arrive St. Helena around 11 and Norm swings me by the pad. &nbsp;Then back again, then to Pattie&#39;s. &nbsp;Bus ride out to winery. &nbsp;Hung out with Dave Brown, very cool guy. &nbsp;What a life. &nbsp;Partied at the winery with Dave and his wife who was also very cool. &nbsp;She told me a story about her father dying. &nbsp;Kind of intense. &nbsp;Roasted marshmallows then came back on the bus. &nbsp;Then home from Patti&#39;s. &nbsp;Hb and I checked out the stars when we got back home.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Started off the day at the Model Bakery in Napa. &nbsp;Then headed out to Calistoga. &nbsp;I went for a long walk and Pat and Hb went shopping. &nbsp;Returned back to Patti&#39;s and walked over to the Napa Valley Olive Oil Company where Michele and I met with Michael Bernstein. &nbsp;It was my first time meeting him. &nbsp;He is 83, 2 years younger than my Dad. &nbsp;We had a nice visit. &nbsp;We sat outside for awhile and then hung out in the car. &nbsp;From there I walked over to Patti&#39;s house for a nice dinner and tirimisu for dessert. &nbsp;It was &nbsp;yummy. &nbsp;Jeff showed up at the end of the day and I hung out with him for a bit towards the end of dinner. &nbsp;It was a gorgeous sunny day in Napa Valley.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Weather this trip has been perfect. &nbsp;Today looks cloudy and rainy. &nbsp;Luckily our drive back to Sac was nice and no rain. &nbsp;We stopped by the house then had a pastry and salad lunch at Estelle&#39;s, a new pasteria close to Pat&#39;s house. &nbsp;We got Pat&#39;s Amazon stick up and running then met Jamie at Whole Foods for a salad dinner. &nbsp;We came home packed up. &nbsp;Jamie came over to say goodbye and pick up his English muffins.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Up at 4:30AM. &nbsp;Left Pat&#39;s house at 5:30AM. &nbsp;By 6:15AM we were way out of Sacramento. &nbsp;By 10AM we were in Redding. &nbsp;We stopped by the tire shop to have our air pressure checked. &nbsp;And by 11AM we were eating breakfast at the COOP in Mt. Shasta. &nbsp;We bought gas in Ashland at the Arco station and then again at exit 99 in Oregon for the same price. &nbsp;We had a real nice dinner in Eugene at our favorite Thai restaurant on 29th. &nbsp;I turned the water back on at the house just at 6:30PM as the sun and light was almost gone in the west. &nbsp;It was a 13 hour journey from start to finish and we were happy to be home. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday 28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phoenix birthday party at the China Buffet. &nbsp;Ryan, Kathy Miller, Lee, Gloria, Diana, and Naj were

class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the morning I went to pick up the mail, then headed over to TJ&#39;s. &nbsp;In the late afternoon I went for a walk around the WL Loop. &nbsp;We only did one walk on our trip last week, and that was in Redding when we walked across the bridge and did a walk in the Arboretum. &nbsp;Can&#39;t believe its been over a week since I went for a walk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday 02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Never left the house today. &nbsp;Hb has been sick with a cold since we returned home from California, and I have been hanging out with her, working away and watching our buddy Gregg Braden talk about simulated realities and other interesting concepts. &nbsp;Plus it was very windy today, and the wind chill factor made it too much to go outside and hang out, so I was tucked in all day today at home.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday 03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was sunny in the morning and turned cloudy and rainy mid day. &nbsp;Around 3PM Hb and I headed over to the COOP for some soup and we ended up hanging with Jim Hagen for about an hour. &nbsp;Hb and he had a good talk and I watched the afternoon and their discussion fade into early evening. &nbsp;I came home and ate the remainder of Hb&#39;s soup with some sprouts I had cooked up earlier in the week. &nbsp;I had a nice talk with Pedro, he is heading out to Hawaii from Miner&#39;s Oaks in a few days. &nbsp;He has been down in southern CA since about Jan 20, right around the time I went to Estero to visit my parents. &nbsp;So he has been there for quite a while.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hb went down to Eugene with Anya and Kathy Miller for a talk at the public library. &nbsp;I hung out and around 1PM went over to Winco and TJ&#39;s and went for a walk over there. &nbsp;It was a partly sunny, rainy, cloudy day. &nbsp;All in all it was nice but cold. &nbsp;In the evening we went to a potluck at Kathy Miller&#39;s house also called Peace House. &nbsp;Jaffer was there and he is going on his annual trek in Spain. &nbsp;We got to know each other better and enjoyed each other&#39;s conversation. &nbsp;I told him about working at Santa Fe Institute and threw the idea out there about the Simulation Argument. &nbsp;Reenie flew into town earlier in the day to tend her daughter Markia who is having some issues with alcohol and cars. &nbsp;Marika&#39;s old boyfriend Ward&#39;s sister came over to visit with us and have some food. &nbsp;She was picking up an extra bike from Kathy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Absolutely gorgeous day and we took full advantage of it. &nbsp;I got outside early afternoon and dug some holes on the east lawn down at Marion. &nbsp;Experimenting with planting fava beans down there. &nbsp;Its the first time I completely mowed the whole lawn. &nbsp;Up till now, we had been mowing most of it, but for the first time today its complete. &nbsp;I figured out how to tilt the lawn mower slightly and then take it all down. &nbsp;Hb found some free Marion berries on Crystal Lake and Alexander so I planted them as well on the side yard down near Marion. &nbsp;Towards evening I went for a walk around the block. &nbsp;Spoke to Ken and Bina this evening. &nbsp;I told Bina that we were not having Hb&#39;s bday party this year. &nbsp;I saw her a few weeks back and she said she would like to come to the party so I told her it was not happening. &nbsp;We had a nice talk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunny day number 2. &nbsp;We love them. &nbsp;In the afternoon I poked some more holes in the ground on the northeast lawn, which will mean for future reference at the corner of the east side yard and marion. &nbsp;I am just beginning to put in a small garden down there post yesterday&#39;s mowing and 4 holes. &nbsp;Now there are 8 holes. &nbsp;I also cleaned up some blackberries in steve&#39;s woods. &nbsp;Earlier in the day I went to pick up some bread at Kerstin&#39;s and had a connection with her regarding her life coaching and my guidance on possibly using Blogger for her website. &nbsp;Came home and had a long talk with Angelica. &nbsp;It started out re: Tim Dehne&#39;s talk this morning re: the grange and them taking it back over from the community group that partially owned it. &nbsp;Then we led into her business, Zillow and the Premier agent platform. &nbsp;Zillow continues to be an interesting business to me and so I was espousing them as a possible partner for advertising dollars. &nbsp;In the evening I wrote a poem for James Rospopo&#39;s birthday. &nbsp;His birthday is the Ides of March.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday 07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">More work outside, punched some more holes in the ground on the east lawn at marion. &nbsp;Long talk with Heidi, she and Bob are back from Hawaii and slated to go again next year. &nbsp;Pop corn for dinner, yummy along with some beet greens. &nbsp;Earlier in the day I had a nice chat with Iris. &nbsp;It was my first time speaking to her since before I left for Florida.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Worked on my taxes all day till 4PM. &nbsp;Earlier in the day I spoke to Liz. &nbsp;Her Mom died back in November. &nbsp;It rained all day today and so therefore I never left the house. &nbsp;Late in the day it was damp, wet, and windy; and even though it wasn&#39;t raining I opted to stay in our warm cozy home in Corvallis, OR.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday 09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hb went to see the movie a Wrinkle in Time. &nbsp;I emailed Patrick and Mindy for the first time since they left about the house the Mexican family used to live in selling for 299K. &nbsp;Spoke to M &amp; D. &nbsp;Hb and I went for a walk in the afternoon. &nbsp;Came home and took a nap then we went to hear the live band at Kirtan. &nbsp;Wil and Kathy were there along with Linda Edwards. &nbsp;Anya came over to our house at 6:30PM. &nbsp;We learned on the ride home that Anya was a pilot in Jackson Hole when she was in her 40&#39;s.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday 10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peggy came over to our house at 11AM. &nbsp;We headed over to the Farmer&#39;s Market. &nbsp;I had a nice talk with Jen&#39;s daughter Sunny, and then the 3 of us went to Gathering Together for lunch. &nbsp;It was our first time there this season and the 2nd week that they have been open. &nbsp;They have a new chef and the meal was average. &nbsp;But we enjoyed hanging out chatting with Peggy until about 2:30PM. &nbsp;Afterwards we did some work in the garden and met our neighbor Lisa who lives at the end of Viewmont next to Crystal Lake. &nbsp;She is from Palo Alto and has lived in Southtown for 16 years.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We left in a fog around 11AM. &nbsp;We were off to lunch in Lebanon at the Thai restaurant which opened at 3PM. &nbsp;We headed east towards Lebanon, went over the Santiam River at our usual spot on the first bridge north of Lebanon and then headed out to the Roaring River County Park in Lacomb for the first time in our lives. &nbsp;It was honey bun&#39;s birthday celebration and we partied in honor of the sunshine. &nbsp;We went on a magic carpet ride through out the afternoon and then landed in Lebanon at our Amazing Thai food living room. &nbsp;We are now starting to be regulars. &nbsp;We had 3 dishes, cause Hb wanted spring rolls and we compromised for lots of extra food. &nbsp;On the way home we went through Tangent and passed Anya&#39;s old stomping grounds. &nbsp;We got home around sunset; the first full day of day light savings. &nbsp;It was a gorgeous, warm, sunny spring time day in Oregon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Another gorgeous day on Hb&#39;s birthday. &nbsp;She went to lunch at Nearly Norml with Jan, Naj, Anya, Renee, and Diana. &nbsp;I worked outside all afternoon, expanding the sidewalk garden further east and planting sunchokes. &nbsp;I bought a bunch of them on Saturday at the Farmer&#39;s Market. &nbsp;Afterwards we went to the Sustainability Coalition annual event at the OSU Alumni center. &nbsp;Afterwards we went for a walk around campus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It rained in the morning and just after noon Hb and I went for a walk around the park. &nbsp;We walked on the wood chips the whole half way. &nbsp;Earlier in the day Hb went to pick up a loaf of bread at Kerstin&#39;s. &nbsp;Hb is now on the gluten free bread bandwagon from Kerstin as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday 14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I met the Bond Starker, the Chairman of the Board, of Starker Forests at the Starker Lecture series on AI by CEO Zack Parisa of

&nbsp;Afterwards I had a nice talk with Bond. &nbsp;Walked downtown and caught the bus home. &nbsp;Dug up a bunch of sunchokes in the front yard and finished round one of putting the blackberries Hb cut back in the yard waste bin. &nbsp;I love working outside now till around 8PM. &nbsp;This is great...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Real nice hike at the Lewisburg saddle. &nbsp;It was my first time heading towards the Arboretum from the top of the saddle. &nbsp;In fact it was my first time heading north, I always went south back towards Corvallis. &nbsp;Made it almost to the Arboretum junction, but did NOT get there. &nbsp;Finished hike around 1:15PM and then headed over to TJ&#39;s for some shopping and then hit the Vitamin Cottage for my Vitamin B-12 which is now part of my daily supplement intake.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday 16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In the evening we

class="c0">&nbsp;speak at the Alumni Center. &nbsp;It was a moving event and one that I really appreciate having the opportunity to be in Corvallis for amazing things at the university to do. &nbsp;Earlier in the day we worked outside on the Marion garden.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday 17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Had a nice talk with John Zeuli.

class="c1"><span class="c2">Bob and Peggy came over for a nice lunch that Hb made. &nbsp;Afterwards we went to the drumming and journeying group. &nbsp;I was my first time meeting Lawrence and participating in the group. &nbsp;It was quite a moving experience for me. &nbsp;Coincidentally, afterwards we watched a movie about </span><span class="c5 c2"><a class="c4"

group that settled there in the 80&#39;s. &nbsp;My experience today, and what drove those people together was eerily similar. &nbsp;Spring time in OR is lovely. &nbsp;When Hb and I went for our walk today. &nbsp;It was calm. &nbsp;When the wind picked up it was cold. &nbsp;The edge of comfort and cold in springtime in OR is a function of the wind. &nbsp;The clouds and the blue sky in contrast make for quite a magnifent blend of beauty.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Went to buy gas at Towne Pump. &nbsp;Mowed the entire lawn, and did a good job. &nbsp;Last time it was cut I did a minimalist job; so it was ready for a full sweep. &nbsp;I did the whole thing with out turning off the mower, and I even handed it off to Hb and she

like I have the past 2 years from you know who. &nbsp;After finishing them up, I celebrated by first picking up my gluten free bread, then going to pay my quarterly TMobile bill, then lunch at the Indian restaurant next door called Nirvana; then I did a hike and ran into Mike Harris who owns the hundred acres below Dimple Hill. &nbsp;It was an absolutely gorgeous day. &nbsp;I now better

&nbsp;This is one of the ugliest days weather wise I have seen this winter. &nbsp;We have been blessed with good weather and have not had to deal with this crap but in a certain respect it is kind of soothing. &nbsp;Came across the theory of multiverse. &nbsp;It fits nicely into the simulation metaphor and was the last paper Stephen Hawking wrote prior to his death a few weeks back. &nbsp;In the

that famous Friday night back in late November 2017 at the Friday night art walk where we randomly walked into an artist gallery and at the back of the studio were two guitarists hanging out by themselves playing music. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday 24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It rained pretty much all afternoon. &nbsp;We went to the Vitamin Cottage and

knew it because late in the night I looked across the street and all of the lights were out. &nbsp;The night prior the porch light had been on and the lights were on in the living room. &nbsp;Heidi is in a better place. &nbsp;We left for Portland and went up a new way. &nbsp;Hwy 22 towards Salem then a left turn on Doakes Ferry. &nbsp;We stopped of at Spring Valley State Park. &nbsp;It was a nice little walk around some wet lands and a view across the river. &nbsp;We headed north and stopped and bought Hb 2 chocolate chip cookies. &nbsp;We then headed over to Champoeg State Park. &nbsp;We drove around but did not stay. &nbsp;Hb went into the visitor center and I waited in the car. &nbsp;From there we headed to New Season&#39;s Market at exit 289 but we went up the back way on Boone&#39;s Ferry Road. &nbsp;Afterwards Will texted us his key location at the back of his house and we let ourselves in. &nbsp;Kathy and Will arrived soon there after and she and Kathy went to the

hose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the morning I did cooking for the potluck tonight. &nbsp;Peter came over at 1PM and stayed till 4.

class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luke, Ashley and kids headed off to the coast and I headed off to Eugene without a plan of where I was going. &nbsp;The universe guided me first to our favorite Thai restaurant on 29th then on to Hwy 58 just south of the 32nd street exit. &nbsp;I headed east and stopped at the Ranger Station just west of Oakridge. &nbsp;A very nice park Ranger lady told me where to camp at the Salmon Creek campground. &nbsp;I found a lovely spot just past the camp ground and just before the bridge. &nbsp;I just pulled my car off the side of the road just so there was a nice spot for my sleeping bag. &nbsp;It took me awhile to realize I was not going to sleep in the car but instead right outside the car. &nbsp;Happened to have a pad, Ridgerest and some other things to lay my sleeping bag down. &nbsp;The weather was perfect in the evening and all night long. &nbsp;It was not too cold. &nbsp;Waking up in the middle of the night and seeing the stars is really lovely. &nbsp;I had not gone camping in OR I don&#39;t think ever ? &nbsp;Will have to check on this... &nbsp;This spot was perfect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Up at the sun which was shining bright. &nbsp;Picked up a bunch of ugly trash down by the river including old aerosol cans and bunch of other garbage and big plastic bags. &nbsp;I dumped them in a trash can just inside the campground. &nbsp;Very convenient. &nbsp;Left my place and headed into town and drove around. &nbsp;Had a long talk with Robert who had moved up from Eugene and was building his house. &nbsp;He used to live on Grant Street in Eugene. &nbsp;We talked in front of the brew pub, it was sunny and warm and lovely in Oakridge. &nbsp;He was a good guy. &nbsp;He was in the army at 18 and had spent some time in the southwest. &nbsp;From there I headed home. &nbsp;I went across the bridge at Lowell into Fall Creek, Jasper and picked up the Hwy 126 to I5 north to Exit 216. &nbsp;Then headed up 99E for the first time in my life to Tangent and took the normal way home from there. &nbsp;Spoke to Will Lerner till around 3PM and then headed home. &nbsp;Everyone was gone. &nbsp;Hb took them up to Portland to catch a 7:30PM plane. &nbsp;I did some laundry and cleaned up garbage and general tidiness around the outside of the house.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday 13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Started dealing with the refridgerator light bulb issue.

the rail yard and the old train station. &nbsp;The ride home towards sun set was lovely. &nbsp;We stopped and looked at our lamb friends hanging out in the field with birds on their back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">First hot summer day in the morning. &nbsp;Hb and I went for a walk in the park down to the river. &nbsp;We had a Father&#39;s Day gathering at Gloria and Diana&#39;s house. &nbsp;Will and Lesley were there and I got to know Will a bit better. &nbsp;Phoenix and Naj&#39;s dog buddy is dying.</span></p><p

&nbsp;The other couple that lives downtown was there whose name is Alan. &nbsp;He is kind of a weird looking guy who was from LA. &nbsp;Then Doug and Rowan showed up and at the end of the evening Linda and Gary House. &nbsp;I got home around 10:30PM and it was still light outside. &nbsp;Its true, the longest day of the year and its light at 10:30PM.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday 22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Got to Bina&#39;s around 10AM. &nbsp;It was a glorious day. &nbsp;Afterwards I hit the Grocery Depot on the way home. &nbsp;Its not too hot and relatively sunny today. &nbsp;At Bina&#39;s it was cloudy and cool, not hot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday 23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Went over to Phoenix&#39;s in the morning to hang out and pay my last respects to Buddy who is dying. &nbsp;I saw a big hole in the back yard and asked Phoenix what is the hole for. &nbsp;He didn&#39;t tell me but let me try and guess. &nbsp;It took me awhile to get it. &nbsp;Once you get something you get it good. &nbsp;We talked about the men&#39;s group possibly with Johng. &nbsp;I picked up Ken and we went out to Beth&#39;s party at her Goodfoot Farm. &nbsp;I did a hike up the hill in Starker Forest. &nbsp;It was a splendid evening. &nbsp;Had a nice talk with Larry who is the person in charge of the Farmer&#39;s market husband and Lucas who is a friend of Bina. &nbsp;He cut his hair and is working for Rachel and Elias at Rainshine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ken came by around 9 and we went to the horse show, then on to Woodie&#39;s which was a trip. &nbsp;He adjusted my neck. &nbsp;Then we stopped by Jude&#39;s for the pond. &nbsp;It was a perfect day. &nbsp;Hb got back from Breitenbush. &nbsp;She went there with Jaffer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Did some massive cutting on the tree leaning over to Jay and Sarah&#39;s yard. &nbsp;Made a very big pile of debris, limbs, branches next to the fire hydrant and behind the traffic guard. &nbsp;It was chilly out this evening, but I had on my long underwear and long sleeve black shirt and I was comfortable. &nbsp;Working at Bina&#39;s outside actually helped me feel better about doing all of this stuff. &nbsp;Earlier in the day Hb went to Walmart in Albany to buy a car set for Jason&#39;s impending arrival in 2 weeks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday market. &nbsp;Finally learned Alberto&#39;s name who is from Rio Rancho and Paul who is Shari Ame&#39;s helper. &nbsp;Also Hannah is back in town since Jarad her boyfriend who is Cheryl&#39;s nephew is back. &nbsp;They cut the north east field finally. &nbsp;So I watered heavily the raspberries and moved some grass clippings there as well. &nbsp;Had a nice talk with Scott Williams. &nbsp;I told him I might be going to Spain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday 27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Installed the fridge light socket and got it correct by taking out the old one and putting in the new one only to discover by accidentally hitting the switch that it was not the light socket at all that I spent $40 on, but it was the switch that is faulty. &nbsp;I read that on the internet but did not understand what they were saying. &nbsp;Oh well, the excitement of discovery in problems and how things work. &nbsp;Thats how discoveries get made in life; very cool. &nbsp;At 5PM we went to Del Alma for dinner. &nbsp;The last time we were there was January 20 after Berto Boyd and Grant Ruiz. &nbsp;We had the special $30 meals and that was alot of food.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Met Diana&#39;s sister Alma at her potluck today. &nbsp;Dan and Amy were there along with Will, Johng, Phoenix. &nbsp;Diana&#39;s brother just bought a new house so Alma was out here to help him move. &nbsp;It was a beautiful night and I sat outside by myself and looked at the clouds.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday 29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We went for a walk in the evening and saw Casey who was tending his farm at the beginning of Park. &nbsp;He took over the spot where Luke used to farm. &nbsp;The plum tree next to his land is now full of plums. &nbsp;Its that time in OR where the fruit on the trees is starting to come out. &nbsp;Summer is now in full bloom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday 30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Woke up, read my email and discovered that Joe P was coming through town. &nbsp;He was driving from Pittsburgh out here to the coast and he stopped by today to hang out with us. &nbsp;We went to the Farmer&#39;s Market in the morning to get some cucumbers and summer squashes. &nbsp;We got back home and Joe had just arrived. &nbsp;He parked in our driveway. &nbsp;We hung out for awhile in the garage and then just as we were about to sit down to lunch Tim Dehne rang our door bell. &nbsp;We all had lunch together and Tim stayed till about 5:30PM along with Joe. &nbsp;They left together. &nbsp;Hb and I went for a walk through the woods in the park.</span></p><p class="c1 c10 c3"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">July 2018</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The day started out cloudy, like I now like it in Oregon. &nbsp;Dealt with my diary part one and archiving it. &nbsp;I love the ritual of this day and doing this semi-annual event. &nbsp;It was done before 9AM. &nbsp;Hb and I went for a nice hike out in the Starker Forest out on Woods Creek Road. &nbsp;It was a gorgeous afternoon and the hike was lovely. &nbsp;Afterwards we had dinner at our favorite Mexican restaurant in Philomath and I learned that they have 4 corn tortillas por un dolar.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hb and I finished cleaning up the tree that was sitting next to the barrier. &nbsp;We cut it up into small pieces and fit it into the bucket. &nbsp;Earlier we went for a walk around the swingset in the park.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Walked over to Renee&#39;s land prior to going to the Tuesday market. &nbsp;Johng was down there on the phone and we talked to him afterwards. &nbsp;He is trying to sell his trailer for 900. &nbsp;Spoke to Ken at the Farmer&#39;s market along with Alberto and his girlfriend Eve. &nbsp;Afterwards we hit the OddFellow&#39;s Meeting. &nbsp;It was our first time there since before Charlie became Nobel Grand back in Feb or March. &nbsp;It was nice to be back to a meeting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday 04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At 7PM we went to get pie at Brynn and Richard&#39;s house down the street. &nbsp;They moved in a few months back. &nbsp;Richard is a softball umpire and pitched for 30 years fast pitch up near Portland Gresham. &nbsp;He worked at Fred Meyer selling jewelery. &nbsp;Hester who lives across the street is from Amsterdam. &nbsp;Helen&#39;s great grand daughter McKenna is 10 years old and Cheryl is her grandmother. &nbsp;Jan stopped by afterward to look at the garlic we harvested earlier in the day. &nbsp;I got all of the garlic from under the fig tree and I have more to do in the other circle bed next door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the morning I swung by the Grocery Depot to pick up some sausages for this evening&#39;s pot luck at Phoenix and Naj&#39;s house. &nbsp;The BBQ was lovely. &nbsp;I had a long talk with Phil. &nbsp;I had only met him once at his house several years back with Renee and Lee Miller, but we sat under the apple tree and enjoyed the evening. &nbsp;We met Shelly, a new person to town, whose husband recently died of pancreatic cancer. &nbsp;She had lived in Montana with her husband on a 40K acre farm. &nbsp;She thinks the cancer might have been caused by eating Peanut Butter. &nbsp;I also had a nice long talk with Cedar who is interested in traveling more to Spanish speaking lands.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday 06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Worked at Bina&#39;s on the black berries next to the big water storage tank, the big tree, and Bina&#39;s old VW Bus. &nbsp;Lots of progress, it was a rather hot day but I was in the shade which was nice. &nbsp;Spent the rest of the day at home mellowed out and working.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday 07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eugene Farmer&#39;s Market followed by Sundance for lunch. &nbsp;Then we drove over to the river near Adam&#39;s office and went for a long walk up to the bridge. &nbsp;Afterwards we had dinner at the lonely planet and then Hb had dessert at the Patiseria. We stopped off in Harrisburg on the way home and hung out at the river.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Spoke to Mom and Dad in the early afternoon. &nbsp;In the late afternoon I finished up the garlic. &nbsp;I am leaning towards not planting garlic this autumn. &nbsp;We can take a year off from garlic and give the soil a break, and plant a cover crop along with some greens.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Walk around the park. &nbsp;Earlier I spoke to Iris. &nbsp;E got a full time job starting this fall at Winchester. &nbsp;I believe she will be teaching Kindergarten. &nbsp;Had a nice email correspondence with Beegee. &nbsp;It was her birthday a few days back. &nbsp;Beegee&#39;s husband flew Maya out to visit with her for 5 days. &nbsp;Pedro got back from a 3 day trip to Santa Fe for Uncle Tom who passed away a few months back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Started out the day with the group coming over for Raja and Hb went to the airport at 10AM. &nbsp;I listened to Raja in the background and afterwards had a long talk with Jaffer about life and what we learned today. &nbsp;While Jaffer was hanging out with me everyone got home from the airport. &nbsp;We drove over to the beach at the river and the dock too, and Nick went swimming along with Munchies. &nbsp;The Tuesday market was packed full of conversations and afterwards I went by Mark&#39;s to pick some spinach and then hung out with Craig and Michael till dusk. &nbsp;Craig came over and we sat in the garage and talked till late. &nbsp;He drank an Espacio beer on ice and I learned more about his life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday 11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nick and I took the bus over to OSU and we walked around. &nbsp;He got a sandwich at Subway and we went over to Chipotle and had a nice lunch. &nbsp;We sat there for awhile and I listened to the techno geek music. &nbsp;It was strange and surreal and not a world I usually live in. &nbsp;But as I sat there for awhile I started to enjoy it. &nbsp;Strange. &nbsp;Afterwards we hit the library briefly, I picked up a short story book with </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hb and the kids go to the coast. &nbsp;Renee and Jaffer come over to do a download, then Pedro comes over to hangout. &nbsp;We sat outside under the tree. &nbsp;I come in and make some lunch and then everyone gets back home. &nbsp;Nick and I go for a walk over to the market stand and get back at midnight. &nbsp;The planets in the summer are lovely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday 13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I watched the kids in the morning and Jason and Hb went shopping. &nbsp;In the afternoon everyone went swimming at the pool and I took a nap and worked. &nbsp;In the evening we had a nice BBQ chicken dinner with mashed potatoes and then Nick and I went for a bike ride. &nbsp;He picked lots of blackberries next to the water facility. &nbsp;It is cooling off nicely this evening. &nbsp;I harvested the Fava beans. &nbsp;All thats left now in the circle garden is the pumpkins, tomatoes, sunflowers and sunchokes. &nbsp;So the Favas are sitting there next to the garden ready to be picked off the vine and put in a bag or box.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday 14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Farmer&#39;s market in the morning followed by McDonald&#39;s for the kids. &nbsp;Came home and I did some cooking. &nbsp;Then we went over to the river and Nick did some laps swimming, getting out, and walking back to the beach. &nbsp;It was hot, sunny, and a gorgeous sunny day on the river. &nbsp;In the evening we did our daily bike ride, but skipped the walk this evening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hang at the house till about 3PM. &nbsp;Then Nick and I stopped by Subway for his sandwich. &nbsp;Then on from there to Cardwell Hill hike. &nbsp;We hiked to the train bridge. &nbsp;Hung out at the bridge, then came back home and stopped by Subway for a re-fill. &nbsp;We had a nice walk at dark over to the swing at the Tuesday market and talked about a lot of life stuff. &nbsp;Nick and I have a really nice bond and connection on this trip. &nbsp;It turned out to be much more than I could have ever imagined. &nbsp;Its a good life !</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Went out to the rock shop in Lebanon and then over to the Roaring River Park. &nbsp;We did the creek and then hung out under the bridge while Nick and Munchies swam. &nbsp;In the evening Jason, Nick and I went down to the river and hung out on the dock and Nick swam around. &nbsp;It was a beautiful evening. &nbsp;At the end of the night Nick and I hung outside till midnight on our final talk. &nbsp;Just before we went to bed I gave him the $10 to also open up the bank account.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The kids leave around 10AM. &nbsp;We go to the Tuesday market around 6PM.

class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday market where we met Tal&#39;s brother from Israel. &nbsp;Afterwards we went over to Peter&#39;s and met

class="c0">Wednesday 25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Around noon I went over and picked up a bunch of apples on Bell. &nbsp;The evening before I had stopped by and asked them if I could have their apples on the ground. &nbsp;I picked up every single apple and brought them back in the wheel barrow. &nbsp;In the evening Hb and I went down to the dock and sat and watched people swim and ride by on their boards. &nbsp;We wat on the river at the bench further down and then swung back around through WL. &nbsp;Summer time in OR is glorious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span

harvested some fava beans that unfortunately turned moldy in the box they were drying in. &nbsp;Farming is a hard road; challenging, just like life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday

Central Park with pizza and music. &nbsp;Tim, Phoenix, Lee, Claude, Rowan, Doug, Ken, Anya, Diana, Kathy Miller, Mike Beilstein and crew. &nbsp;It was a very nice evening. &nbsp;Idyllic so to speak.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">August 2018</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday

along the forest path in the river and discussed the next steps for my winter plans. &nbsp;In the evening she went to Diana&#39;s house for a potluck. &nbsp;The whole gang was there but I decided to stay home and chill out for numerous reasons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday 03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Got up and made my reservation to go home to Pittsburgh on October 23 returning on November 05. &nbsp;I had a long talk with Dad about this whole deal 2 days back and we hashed out the face that coming home later in the month and spending time at their house while they were gone in Fl. did not make a whole lot of sense because the weather is crappy plus they were NOT too keen on Hb staying at their house either which basically puts a kabash on that concept. &nbsp;I have been putting a lot of energy into this whole concept recently so its good to at least figure out what the heck is going on in part I. &nbsp;Now I need to deal with what I / we are going to do this winter. &nbsp;At least for now I will have the Pittsburgh part figured out and we can worry about the next step another day. &nbsp;Hb and I went to the Benton County Fair in the afternoon. &nbsp;We took the free bus from the stadium. &nbsp;It was a gorgeous evening. &nbsp;Hb had an ice cream cone and then a big ol fat 1/3 cheese burger. &nbsp;Yum. &nbsp;At dark, we had a nice talk with our neighbor Steve and I ate some blackberries.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday 04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Farmer&#39;s Market in the morning. &nbsp;Had a long talk with the corn guy Paul. &nbsp;He told me all about pigs and artificial insemination. &nbsp;The whole process in detail, fascinating. &nbsp;We talked to Rebecca&#39;s husband Larry who is considering coming to the Tuesday market starting in September. &nbsp;In the afternoon we went over to David and Tamara Goldstein&#39;s house with Renee. &nbsp;They live on Viewmont the next to last house on the left. &nbsp;He is a writer. &nbsp;Very interesting folks with a lovely house. &nbsp;The tea and crumpets were good too. &nbsp;Afterwards we helped Linda Edwards on the Court house lawn knock down her exhibit. &nbsp;Brynn, our new neighbor was happy to see us there. &nbsp;In the evening Phoenix and I went for a walk around the park.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday

class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hb was still out at the coast and got home around dinner time. &nbsp;I went swimming over at the pool and attempted to clear out my ear wax. &nbsp;I think it worked. &nbsp;It was a gorgeous day. &nbsp;Not too hot, but hot enough to enjoy the pool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mailed off a check to Nick for $100 at the PO. &nbsp;I gave him the money while he was out here and he recently opened a bank account to deposit the check into.

class="c0">Cheryl and Michael&#39;s 8/8 party with Peter. &nbsp;It was a warm lovely night for the party. &nbsp;I had a nice talk with Steve who told me about sleep cycles and appreciating the time when you wake up early in the morning. &nbsp;Earlier in the day Tim stopped by to check in. &nbsp;He is once again running for Benton County commisioner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the evening we went with Phoenix over to Starker Park to see a concert and ended up hanging out at the duck pond. &nbsp;We walked around the gardens and ran into Johng and Renee who we were planning to meet there as well. &nbsp;It was a lovely evening. &nbsp;Earlier in the day I swung by the bank for Saturday&#39;s adventure to

at Bites. &nbsp;We got the lunch special of a nice pork dish. &nbsp;It was yummy. &nbsp;Afterwards we went over to the library and read for awhile and then headed out Hwy 26 to Henry Rieman Campground

22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Got up with a nice breakfast of watermellon and greens from what I cooked on Monday. &nbsp;We went for a hike up the trail from the campground for a few hours. &nbsp;It was pretty steep and up and down. &nbsp;Got back to the campground and had a Lar Bar Pedro gave us about 6 months back. &nbsp;At 1pm we left for the coast. &nbsp;We were in Astoria by

cream with chocolate sauce. &nbsp;We went home and I went for a walk out towards the tower hill and then returned home. &nbsp;The day was foggy with no sun. &nbsp;Astoria is an interesting place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Breakfast at our place followed by walk around downtown to check out the shops. &nbsp;We had a nice lunch of eggs at the Columbian. &nbsp;We then walked all the way to under the bridge and past near the docks where the smaller boats are. &nbsp;From there we took the trolley down to the 39th pier and then back again to around 12th. &nbsp;The trolley driver gave us the tour with some humor. &nbsp;We then walked around more and watched a lady learn about glass blowing. &nbsp;We then had a nice dinner of sushi; it was light and airy. &nbsp;We walked around the hills to sunset and then I went on an added walk up the trail from our house continuuing up 12th for another bit. &nbsp;The day was magnificent, partly sunny with some blue sky.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday 24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Checked out about 10:30am after packing up the car. &nbsp;We

home and drove over to Safeway to get some ice. &nbsp;We also stopped off at the COOP for some food. &nbsp;Drove across the bridge and had a nice lunch at an Irish pub in Gray&#39;s landing called Duffy&#39;s. &nbsp;Diane worked there who moved here from Westminster near Denver. &nbsp;She moved here two years ago and was our waitress. &nbsp;Headed over to the Skamokawa Resort, checked into our room and then drove out to the National Wildlife refuge. &nbsp;We went for an hour hike on the dirt road and then had a nice baked potato at the Duck Inn next to our hotel. &nbsp;I walked over to the beach at dusk and checked out everyone having a campfire.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday 25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Splendid day in Cathlamet after a nice morning at our humble resort abode. &nbsp;We got there and rode over to the ferry port. &nbsp;Afterwards we hung out on the Puget Island and rested on the side of the road. &nbsp;The sun began to appear briefly. &nbsp;We love the PNW. &nbsp;We headed into town and had delicious gluten free assortment of goodies including 2 chocolate chip cookies, a medium pizza, a ruben and a lovely salad. &nbsp;The food lasted for lunch and dinner and we each kicked in $20. &nbsp;And I was worried about us finding food in this neck of the woods once we left Astoria. &nbsp;Turns out the universe took care of us once again. &nbsp;After lunch we headed down to the docks for a rest on the shore, went out on the docks to look at the boats, and then hung out looking out over the river bay of the Columbia. &nbsp;The afternoon slowly passed and we walked from the marina into town. &nbsp;Along the way I picked up a nice batch of pears that had fallen from a neighbor tree. &nbsp;The pears are ready to go just like the black berries. &nbsp;We stayed in town till around 4PM and just then as we were driving back home it started to sprinkle. &nbsp;Our timing was magnificent. &nbsp;We got in a day of wandering and sight seeing the area and made it home safe and sound back to our nice room 2 over looking the harbor and the river to the south. &nbsp;I picked up 3 nice books. &nbsp;The Return of the King, the third in a series of the Lord of the Rings along with poetry books by Ralph Waldo Emerson and Walt Whitman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 26</span></p><p class="c1"><span

started out with a long talk with Nick who looked like Andy. &nbsp;He was just sitting there drinking his coffee in the chair at the condo next door. &nbsp;He wasn&#39;t staying there but enjoyed sitting there in the morning. &nbsp;He saw lots of wildlife over the years. &nbsp;Why make coffee when you can go out and buy it next door. &nbsp;He was lonely, but friendly. &nbsp;We talked about his life and he gave me advice I asked for which was play it by ear and don&#39;t force things. &nbsp;His chat with me, in reference to Emerson last evening was very appropriate. &nbsp;From there we had the senior breakfast at the Duck Inn and then went into Cathlamet for block ice. &nbsp;We got to the ferry terminal about 45 minutes early just as the folks were getting off. &nbsp;We hung out there on the water and at noon on the bell the ferry crossed the Columbia. &nbsp;We loved being out on the water. &nbsp;We stopped by and got some lunch to go at Clatskanie and then went on to our camp site back at Henry Rierson. &nbsp;We got our tent up and ate our dinner we had just picked up and then it started raining. &nbsp;It was still raining when we woke up at 3am. &nbsp;Actually, the rain had stopped but it was still very wet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Up at 3am because a chipmunk was trying to get in our tent from underneath the ground. &nbsp;I was worried it was going to chew through the tent. &nbsp;It was pitch dark. &nbsp;Luckily we had a light, key concept for camping. &nbsp;By 4am we were on the road. &nbsp;We got home at 7:30am and was greeted by Patrick and Juniper who were going for a walk around the block. &nbsp;Bob stopped by too, coming back from his walk. &nbsp;It was our first time seeing Patrick since he got home on Saturday, 3 days ago. &nbsp;He came separately from Mindy because his truck broke down. &nbsp;The afternoon became sunny and hot and it dried out all of our sleeping bags. &nbsp;In the evening we hung out with Patrick, Mindy, Izzy, and Juniper, Doug and Jamie at the end of the street. &nbsp;It was the first time we were all together since Patrick and Mindy left about one year ago.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim Dehne&#39;s forum in the evening along with mayor forum. &nbsp;Afterwards I spoke to

&nbsp;We are staying downtown.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Got up and had breakfast at our motel. &nbsp;Then hung out in our room in the morning. &nbsp;Went for a drive around Pendleton and had a nice salad and reuben for lunch downtown. &nbsp;The sun came out and I went for a walk and talked to Bob Egerman whose Mom had passed away between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. &nbsp;Hb and I went back out for a walk on the river walk. &nbsp;It was a gorgeous afternoon and we now know Pendleton downtown area pretty well.</span></p><p

got almost a 2 hour tour of the brothel scene in the early 1900&#39;s. &nbsp;It was a bunch of basements of buildings all connected with stuff down there to show what was up. &nbsp;They get about 20K visitors per year times 15 bucks. &nbsp;After that we had a nice lunch at Mo Pho, yummy Pad Thai and soup. &nbsp;From there we drove up Hwy 11 and then over the mountains to Elgin. &nbsp;We had an Airbnb disaster in Enterprise where the heaters in the place were broken. &nbsp;So Hb decided to bail. &nbsp;Luckily, prior to that we went through the town of Wallowa and stopped by the </span><span

evening on our phone wireless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Up early. &nbsp;Left Prairie City around 8AM, it was 260 miles from there to our house. &nbsp;We left at 8AM, got home at 4PM with a stop for lunch in Sister&#39;s at Angelina&#39;s and a hike in the park 10 miles east of Sweethome. &nbsp;The drive was a good one. &nbsp;The

Kaveh Golabi in the morning. &nbsp;I was getting emails that were forwarded from my Liquid Designers account. &nbsp;We had a nice chat and spoke for about one hour. &nbsp;Late in the day we did some

Queen. &nbsp;I am learning my way around Albany a bit more. &nbsp;Got home and a few hours later got a load of horse manure, yes !, wow... &nbsp;Started moving it immediately to the driveway bed for garlic. &nbsp;Potluck for Dan and Amy&#39;s 68th birthday. &nbsp;Dan and Hb were born the same year.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hb

worked more on my garlic bed dirt project. &nbsp;It was a gorgeous sunny day !</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Massive cleaning day. &nbsp;Pulled out all of my books in both rooms, dusted them off outside and took them back in. &nbsp;In my bedroom I moved the dresser and vacuumed behind it. &nbsp;In my office, I pulled out the bookshelf and vacuumed behind. &nbsp;Clearly, it was a gorgeous sunny day outside, almost hot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday 12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">More dirt

14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Completed M18 harvest and processing and tucked it away in jars. &nbsp;We still have one plant left from Steve that we will harvest just prior to trip departure. &nbsp;Very nice potluck at Katy&#39;s house. &nbsp;The whole earth rising crew was there which was great. &nbsp;We gave Linda and Ken a ride out to the farm. &nbsp;We brought back 3 jars of cider.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mellow day for the most part. &nbsp;I went to bed at 8PM and slept for a long time. &nbsp;At around 5PM I went for a short walk around the block and relished in the beauty of my home. &nbsp;It was a gorgeous sunny day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Short walk around the block mid-day gorgeous day in Paradise. &nbsp;In the evening we went to hear EV Smith, Grand Master speak and have dinner with him at the lodge. &nbsp;Hb was the chaplain and did all 3 prayers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday 17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Took Hb to the airport at 9:30AM. &nbsp;On the way home stopped by and picked up a load of winter squash. &nbsp;Pedro came over in the afternoon and we hung out for a few hours. &nbsp;Then I went for a walk in the park and ran into Mark. &nbsp;We walked back to his house and we hung out for awhile and he gave me a butternut squash to take home.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Another incredibly gorgeous day in Paradise. &nbsp;Pedro brought over the ladder so I can do the leaves prior to departured. &nbsp;I planted 120 cloves today of garlic. &nbsp;Peter gave me some moral and mental assistance. &nbsp;It was a great day. &nbsp;Bob is taking his trailer out tomorrow on his maiden voyage with his new truck. &nbsp;Its the first time out since Heidi died back in May. &nbsp;I helped him make sure he did not hit the side of his fence. &nbsp;At just before dusk I walked over to the trees at the water company and walked to the end. &nbsp;It was a magnificent mid autumn evening and I was happy to be alive. &nbsp;I saw Mushroom and Linda on the walk back. &nbsp;I spoke to Hb briefly in NM. &nbsp;She is staying at Judith&#39;s house, Diana is in town from Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday 19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Another incredibly beautiful day. &nbsp;I will note that the day after I leave next week on Tuesday the weather is supposed to turn crappy. &nbsp;In other words, the weather is staying GORGEOUS up until the day that I leave and then it turns cloudy and wet. &nbsp;Amazing, how lucky I am this year with the weather. WOW. &nbsp;Anyway, today I did all of the gutters. &nbsp;Bob took his trailer out to Eugene to get a backup camera. &nbsp;I helped him guide the trailer out of his driveway yesterday. &nbsp;I got my ballot yesterday and voted today. &nbsp;Yesterday, Pedro brought us back the ladder so that I could work all day doing the gutters. &nbsp;I also did some canning, by using up all of the fruit that was remaining in the fridge by canning some peaches and pears. &nbsp;Wow, I am starting to figure out how to do this. &nbsp;This is quite a skill to have, and actually a nice alternative to freezing stuff. &nbsp;The key is to fill up the jar that has a seal lid almost to the top when the material is very hot, and then the lid pops in and you know you have a good seal. &nbsp;Very, very cool and will be used for the rest of my life. &nbsp;I love this stuff...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday 20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Farmer&#39;s Market long talk with Paul, the corn guy. &nbsp;It was his last market, his grandson was there too... &nbsp;Then I talked to Ken for awhile and then said goodbye to Bina who is leaving on her trip to Germany. &nbsp;Back in January. &nbsp;Then I stopped by Francesca&#39;s for a tamale. &nbsp;Then stopped by Dale Donavan&#39;s studio as the first stop on the Philomath Studio Tour. &nbsp;From there I headed over to Faye Cummins and hung out with her husband Fred Berman. &nbsp;I was there for along while, possibly till 4PM. &nbsp;Then I headed over to Bimart for some MSM and stopped by TJ&#39;s for my final food stop prior to going back home to Pittsburgh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Packed all morning. &nbsp;In the afternoon I cut down all of the sun chokes in the front yard. &nbsp;Then I went for a walk around the block. &nbsp;Mike Jordan stopped by and he and I chatted about him finding a person to live in his house the whole time they are gone. &nbsp;There is a short term property manager here in Corvallis that deals with that stuff...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Big fog morning in the valley, so I did not leave until past 10:30AM. &nbsp;Drive up was mellow, and I stopped at our normal rest area. &nbsp;Then on to Season&#39;s in Happy Valley. &nbsp;Don&#39;t need to go out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the way again to go there, our usual spot rocks. &nbsp;Checked in, then went to Season&#39;s for some food. &nbsp;Then came back to the hotel and went for a nice walk around the block. &nbsp;It was a beautiful day and I am doing fine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Up at 2:30AM and got a good night sleep. &nbsp;Being at the end of the hall was surprisingly quiet and I did not hear the door bang at all after going to bed around 9AM. &nbsp;So I got a good almost 6 hours. &nbsp;The first minor snafu was the engine leaking fluid. &nbsp;Luckily in Chicago my plane was delayed about an hour. &nbsp;Wish I would have known that sooner. &nbsp;But my mantra of &quot;the universe is going to take care of you&quot; worked really well; keep working on it across the board for other issues you are dealing with in your life. &nbsp;Took the bus home from the airport without an hassles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday 24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">First full day at home. &nbsp;Woke up early in the morning and pulled out the baseball cards, pictures. &nbsp;I am getting to work on dealing with the remainder of my stuff left at my parents house. &nbsp;In the early afternoon we went to hear a jazz concert on the history of jazz at CMU for M &amp; D&#39;s Osher class</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Iris and I took a walk over to Phipps Conservatory. &nbsp;It was a lovely day in Pittsburgh, slightly chilly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday 26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Robert, Dad and I go to the Golf Club for lunch. &nbsp;Afterwards we hit the book store to give away most of our remaining books that were in the house. &nbsp;In the evening Robert, Andy, Debbie, Kerry and Joe Fleckenstein go the Aviary for a PennFutures event in honor of outgoing president Larry Schweiger</span><span class="c11">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday 27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Eleven people are dead in a shooting at </span><span class="c5 c2"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tolols.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1546463112309000">Tree of Life</a></span><span class="c0">, a Squirrel Hill Synagogue. &nbsp;It was the deadliest attack in US History on Jews, and M &amp; D live a 15 minute walk from the place and I was home for it. &nbsp;I went for a walk early afternoon over toward Shadyside. &nbsp;I went with M &amp; D over to their new house and we had a nice buffet dinner. &nbsp;It was my first time there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Spoke to Leah Angerman and her daughter Tova on FaceTime. &nbsp;Tova is 3 years old and her birthday is August 12, 2015. &nbsp;I went for a walk over to CMU. &nbsp;It started to rain so I walked under the trees for awhile and then in the garage. &nbsp;Spoke to Hb early in the day along with Aunt Harriet. &nbsp;I also had a long talk with Harriet yesterday as well. &nbsp;People were calling us in regard to the shooting yesterday at the Temple.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dad and I drop mother off at Dr. Harris and then we go down to his lawyers office to sign some papers for the property being taken over by the Turnpike commission. &nbsp;I get a call from the doctor&#39;s office while Dad is up in the office that we have to take mother to the emergency room. &nbsp;Then I talk to Larry at the doctor&#39;s office while Dad is inside talking to Harris and basically yell and scream at him that mother does not have to go to the ER tonight, that it is NOT an emergency. &nbsp;I get in the car and go with Mom and Dad and in the middle of Forbes mother makes a comment and I get out of the car in the middle of the street and almost get hit by a bus. &nbsp;Oh good... :) &nbsp;I walk home. &nbsp;Iris explains to me later that the system is so broken that the only way for mother to get properly evaluated immediately is to go to the ER. &nbsp;Turns out Harris wanted mother to go to a cardiologist awhile back but she never did it. &nbsp;Side story... &nbsp;Mother had a serious case of exima and so a day or two after I got home she was taking Prednisone which might have caused the swelling in her legs and might have exacerbated shortness of breath. Stay tuned, the day is not over yet...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I take Dad out to St. Clair Hospital. &nbsp;On the way home there is a detour on W. Liberty Ave and I have to go all around and we end up to the entrance to the tunnel. &nbsp;As I approach home there are thousands of people at Rodef for a funeral re: the 11 people who were killed 2 days ago. &nbsp;So I make a right turn on 5th from Morewood and park the car in the garage. &nbsp;Then I walk over to Whole Foods. &nbsp;On the way home, I stop by an art gallery who the artist and owner of the gallery is Ellen Chisdes Neuberg who owns a gallery called Gallerie Chiz. &nbsp;Actually she shut the gallary down a few years back and she now uses it as her own studio and she has another artist in the way back. &nbsp;Turns out I spoke to her for hours, she is 79 and has had a very interesting life. &nbsp;I got home about 2PM and headed right back out to go to TJ&#39;s. &nbsp;By now, the Rodef funeral was over and I was able to easily head out and come back. &nbsp;The key point was the parking at TJ&#39;s. &nbsp;I parked across the street from TJ&#39;s on the corner of Penn Ave. and where Shady dead ends into Penn. &nbsp;Then I walked across the street using the island in the middle of Penn as my safe haven. <br>Wednesday 31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Parked on Hobart. &nbsp;Then walked down to Murray Ave and continued on along Hobart all the way into the park. &nbsp;That was my first time in the park at that location. &nbsp;I came back and had a gigantic greek salad with 5 HUGE falafels. &nbsp;It was a Kings meal and I ate every last lick of it. &nbsp;Afterwards I stopped by Amazing Books and records and Eric was there and I got my </span><span class="c2 c5"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Rumi-New-Expanded/dp/0062509594&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1546463112311000">Essential Rumi</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;along with Mansfield Park by Jane Austen. &nbsp;Eric shipped me the books as I already have too many books to take home including Clemente in Spanish and 100 days of Solitude. &nbsp;In the evening I helped my Dad balance his check book. &nbsp;Spoke to my Mom in the hospital and she sounds really good. &nbsp;Hopefully she will come home tomorrow.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">November 2018</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Walked down Morewood to Millvale and crossed the bridge which goes over the railroad tracks and busway. &nbsp;Its kind of a hollow but no water. &nbsp;Then you turn left on Liberty Avenue which turns into Main and you go down the hill. &nbsp;Then I made a right turn on Butlet and followed that all the way down to the Allegheny Cemetery. &nbsp;Then I went into a pub for a break, and headed back out and was home. &nbsp;On the way home, I stopped at an Italian store and bought some dried figs. &nbsp;The weather was lovely and cloudy and I wore shorts and 2 T-shirts and my blue long underwear top in the beginning of the walk but once I warmed up I no longer needed it. &nbsp;Mother got home just after 5PM. &nbsp;Happy to have her back home. &nbsp;She was in the hospital for 3 nights, Mon, Tue, Wed, home on Thursday.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday 02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">First full day that Mom is back home. &nbsp;Iris came over in the afternoon for awhile. &nbsp;Then I walked up the steps from the apartment just up Fifth. &nbsp;At the top of the hill I walked around a bit, and then headed down the hill to Wilkins. &nbsp;Then I walked up Wilkins and made a quick left on Dunmoyle. &nbsp;As I walked down to the end of that street I ran into Wightman and made a right turn and took that all the way to Forbes, and then came back the same way. &nbsp;Upon arrival at home I took a shower and then went over to Iris&#39;s lobby and hung out with David for about one hour. &nbsp;We had a nice chat. &nbsp;The last time I saw him was 2 years ago in the autumn of 2016.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday 03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dad and I took mother to the beauty shop, and then came home and went back to pick her up. &nbsp;In the early afternoon we went over to the library to meet with Christopher M. Zappa from Health Benefit Services (HBS) whom Norman Edelstein recommended to Dad. &nbsp;I added him in to my contacts as he was very knowledgeable about his field and has been in it for 13 years. &nbsp;In the evening we went to dinner at M &amp; D&#39;s new future house called Provident Point. &nbsp;The food is very nice and we had a good time. &nbsp;I drove home and we stopped along the way and got 15 in gas. &nbsp;The night was chilly and dry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Very nice walk over to Chatham College. &nbsp;Dunmoyle to Kipling to Fair Oaks to Murray Hill to Woodland Road to Chatham College to an interaction with a cop as I came out of Chatham at the Tree of Life. &nbsp;The road was still blocked off and I think he was surprised to see me. &nbsp;It was a lovely fall autumn day in Pittsburgh and a poignant end to a trip that was not perfect but filled with some anticipation and angst. &nbsp;In the end, it was a good journey to see my parents who are now 86 and 84. &nbsp;I helped Dad some today on his new chrome book; and discovered that if you just close the lid just like on the Macbook you don&#39;t need to log in each time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dad took me to the bus and I got on at 8:30am, was at the airport by 9:30. &nbsp;Learned quickly that it was going to be a long day as an airport lost power and so my plane from STL to PDX was delayed 3 hours. &nbsp;Hb picked me up at the Red Lion and we were home by 9:30PM. &nbsp;It all went smoothly. &nbsp;I sat next to a very interesting guy on the plane who had gone to the Naval academy, was in the Navy for 8 years and then started working for Shell on off shore oil rigs. &nbsp;He now has a great job being a problem solver. &nbsp;We had a good heart to heart talk on the plane and it was one of those really nice talks. &nbsp;He was born in 1983 and his parents were born in 1961. &nbsp;Had a nice lunch in St. Louis at the end of the terminal. &nbsp;I brought a nice lux salmon sandwich on my gluten free bun along with some rice and brussel sprouts, salami et al. &nbsp;I ate more food on the plane about an hour before we landed in PDX and then Hb gave me some nice french fries she had gotten at dinner with Licia for fish and chips.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">First day back was gorgeous outside. Hb had her group over and I listened to the first part then took a nap for about 2 hours. &nbsp;Afterwards we ate lunch and then I went outside and started tilling the fig tree bed to plant some more garlic. &nbsp;First round of garlic is up and running and looking really nice. &nbsp;Hb got in there and started doing some weeding to trim back all of the clover etc. that came up as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday 07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Another beautiful day. &nbsp;I got the garlic in the ground after a final bit of compost was thrown in the bed. &nbsp;Yesterday I added the bulk of the material and today I finished it off and planted around 60 garlic cloves. &nbsp;The other bed has about 120 cloves so in total we have about 180 cloves in the ground. &nbsp;In the evening we went to the Majestic Theatre for the 2nd talk in the annual Native American Talk Series. &nbsp;Unfortunately, it was not very good and we embarassedly had to leave early.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yesterday I messed up and raked the fir tree needles on to my leaf compost dirt pile adjacent to the open space. &nbsp;Today I went back in and got rid of the needles. &nbsp;Never again will I rake needles that way. &nbsp;I want to rake the needles towards the fence and then do a clean up. &nbsp;Oh well, because it was not wet, or had not rained since yesterday I was easily able to scrape the needles back off the leaf and dirt and put it in the yard waste dumpster. &nbsp;After finishing that off, it didn&#39;t take long I did a massive leaf collection for the rest of the afternoon. &nbsp;Got a bunch of leaves on Marion at the end of the street and then 2 piles across Ryan on Marion. &nbsp;Then came back and got some leaves on our street from the folks next to Jason whose name escapes me. &nbsp;Now I remember Jerry and Hester&#39;s house. &nbsp;From there I got some leaves from Doug and Jamie. &nbsp;So my leaves are now in good shape. &nbsp;This year I spread them out with a rake and they look real nice. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday

Hen</a></span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;Joseph the spiritual farmer who lives down near Steve Rose and I met at the Farmer&#39;s market last summer is the dishwasher there. &nbsp;I also met owner John JC Mersmann for the first time and told him about corn tortillas. &nbsp;He has a limited menu, but I was happy to put in my 2 cents. &nbsp;Afterwards we did the food shopping circuit stopping by the Grocery Depot and TJ&#39;s. &nbsp;On the way we stopped off at Green Gable and got our winter squash for 30 cents a pound. &nbsp;Jaffer came over and we did the Raja downloads. &nbsp;Today was cold and partly cloudy with patches of sun as well. &nbsp;In the evening we went to the Vista and Vineyards Art show at OSU. &nbsp;We met Dee Yarnell who won Best of Show. &nbsp;We also sat and shared some food with Lottie, David and Anya was there too. &nbsp;We met Jon Luc&#39;s wife Valerie who was an artist in the show.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday 10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Farmer&#39;s market followed by lunch at Dave and Lottie&#39;s. &nbsp;It was our first time to their house. &nbsp;They live across the street from Janet, Michele&#39;s yoga instructor. &nbsp;We were at their house from 12:30 to 4:30PM. &nbsp;We had a very nice day spending time with them. &nbsp;On the way home we stopped off at the COOP to buy some millet, curry powder, and some salad stuff. &nbsp;It was a gorgeous sunny day. &nbsp;The leaves were falling, and autumn is in full bloom. &nbsp;It is really our first time hanging out in Corvallis the whole month of November since we have been spending time in Ashland mostly the last number of years.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nice early afternoon at the Tuesday market stand for a bird day event. &nbsp;I had nice chats with Janelle and Stony. &nbsp;Mindy and Patrick were there and I took Patrick down to the lower land to hang out a bit with Lion and we talked to Johng too. &nbsp;Afterwards we walked through the park and over to the river. &nbsp;It was a perfect autumn day, the leaves were every where and Hb and I were happy holding hands. &nbsp;In the evening Pedro and Anya came over for a nice salmon dinner, with dal, brussel sprouts, quinoa, and our first batch of winter squash which we also took to Dave and Lottie&#39;s house on Saturday.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Round 1 of picking up Jay and Sarah&#39;s leaves. &nbsp;Then I raked our back yard as well, and got all of the leaves. &nbsp;I tidied up the herb garden including removing the big herb plant that we harvested upon returning from Eastern Oregon. &nbsp;There were still some little buds on there that I got off, and then dug it out, and added a bunch of leaves and manure to the hole. &nbsp;Should be ready for spring planting. &nbsp;Renee came over in the evening to hang out with Hb.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the afternoon Hb and I went over to Naj and Phoenix&#39;s house for some tea. &nbsp;Phoenix walked home with us and I walked back to his house and then back home. &nbsp;In the morning, Renee, Kathy, and Jaffer were over for the Raja class.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday 14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lunch with Suzanne and Pedro at New Morning Bakery. &nbsp;Afterwards I collected leaves in the yard waste bin. &nbsp;I had a nice talk with Leonard who has the apple trees. &nbsp;I got his leaves. &nbsp;He brought out a rake at dusk so I could get the last amount.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">More leaves, a gorgeous day and I love OR. &nbsp;Hb went out with Anya to the Whiteside Theatre to see a play or a movie.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday 16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Big news of the day was the fact my garbage man, who was very nice, came by and he lifted the toilet into the recycle dumpster and he then used that to dump it into the truck. &nbsp;Very cool. &nbsp;In the morning I did my Thanksgiving shopping by going to TJ&#39;s, the Vitamin Cottage and Grocery Depot. &nbsp;The Grocery Depot is on my circuit on my shopping network and I like doing that. &nbsp;In the afternoon we went over to OSU to the new Multicultural Center for Literacy for their Thanksgiving potluck. &nbsp;They moved into the new house on Jackson and their old house closer to town and the library called the Sunflower house was torn down. &nbsp;We had fun and ate too much food.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday 17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kicked off the day at the Farmer&#39;s Market. &nbsp;Hung out with Johng, Ken, Larry who sells apples, we were standing with his Studebaker, Amy and Dan, Kathleen. &nbsp;It was a glorious day. &nbsp;Hb had two tameles de Francesca and then we went out to the Arboretum. &nbsp;We did the entire 36 loop trail, the day was sublime, sunny, warm all sublime words. &nbsp;Got home and Phoenix met us at the door, then Jan came in Hb&#39;s room and we chatted then I walked down the street and pedro came over and I gave him his gift of celery I got today from Nancy. &nbsp;In the evening Hb went out with Anya to Imagine Coffee.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Check out the new housing development on Harrison and Circle Drive. &nbsp;Wow, they did a great job with the housing development tucked back into the side of the hill and the front wetlands left untouched. &nbsp;Then on to Oak Creek parking spot and walked behind the Audubon Center onto the housing development and around the hood up there. &nbsp;Then Sundays @ 3pm concert on Harrison and 35th Street to see a piano soloist. &nbsp;Gluten free cookies afterward that were yummy with grapes and 2 oranges. &nbsp;It was a warm, sunny day but by the time I got home and did a little work outside it was cold.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finished cleaning up pine cones and needles and putting them in the yard waste bin. &nbsp;Then move on to round 2 of the gutters, and completed it rather quickly. &nbsp;Its been real dry so the clean out was easy. &nbsp;It supposed to start raining in a few days so getting it done prior when its warm and dry is way easier than cold and wet. &nbsp;Kerstin and Mike&#39;s house got some new folks and they moved in a trailer. &nbsp;They are in Costa Rico until June 1. &nbsp;The pink house on Ryan that was trashy had both of its trees cut down in front of the house. &nbsp;Definitely makes it more appealing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Got up early, around 5am. &nbsp;Left the house at 7:30AM and was at KP Lancaster around 8:30AM. &nbsp;It takes about an hour to get there, and it was foggy. &nbsp;Saw the eye doctor and my primary care physician and was home by around 1PM. &nbsp;Going to the doctors is not the highlight of my life so there is not much to say except that the whole experience was uneventful. &nbsp;Came home and put in the drain spout covers I bought at Lowes. &nbsp;Two needed replaced. Then got some leaves from Jay and down the street. &nbsp;I met our new neighbors Lynn and Shirley who live next to Jay and Sarah. &nbsp;They are the parents of the son who used to live in that house and now lives in Portland.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday 21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Spoke to M &amp; D in the morning, and had a very long talk with Scott about parents, and his projects in concert with using DO and Docker. &nbsp;We went over to Naj and Phoenix&#39;s house at 1PM and we set up our table. &nbsp;I helped Naj and Phoenix get back on the internet and helped Phoenix set up his new laptop. &nbsp;We went to Nearly Normals for lunch. &nbsp;I had the falafel and black bean plate. &nbsp;Came home and Hb and I went for a walk around the block.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of the best Thanksgivings ever for me. &nbsp;Arrived at Phoenix&#39;s house at 1PM and he served me up the magical potion; less than a teaspoon. &nbsp;I was the first and only person to be blessed with the liquer. &nbsp;The rest of the day was beautiful. &nbsp;Wil, Kathy, Renee, Johng, Diana, Gloria, Lexi, Ildi, Anya, Pedro, Phoenix, Naj, Brenda, Hb, and me. &nbsp;There were 15 people at Thanksgiving. &nbsp;Pedro, Wil and I sat at the end of the table with Naj and Hb. &nbsp;Wil and Pedro had a nice little comedic routine going all day. &nbsp;It was fun and funny, I laughed a lot and so did Hb. &nbsp;At the end of the evening Dan and Amy came by and Johng sang my birthday song. &nbsp;I was in heaven. &nbsp;He then proceeded to jam with Amy for about another 45 minutes. &nbsp;Hb and I got home and went for a short walk. &nbsp;The moon was full and bright and all was peaceful in the southtown hood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday 23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Got up early and went to Bed Bath and Beyond to get another blanket like the one I have on my bed in the winter for Hb and I bought a pair of sheets for my bed. &nbsp;I needed a new pair, and had been using the sheets from Placitas. &nbsp;Came home and stopped by Naj&#39;s house to pick up our table we lent her. &nbsp;Then I came home and did leaves till dark. &nbsp;Wil and I had a long talk on the street when the sun was out briefly. &nbsp;It rained the rest of the afternoon and I got lots more leaves. &nbsp;I think I am pretty good :)...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday 24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hb and I went downtown for lunch to Bellhop. &nbsp;Then we walked over to OSU. &nbsp;It was a nice day after rain the past 2 days.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ken came over for breakfast around 9am and left around 11PM. &nbsp;Hb went to the movie and I helped our neighbor Sally move leaves from the street to her back yard. &nbsp;It was my first time ever spending time or hanging out with her. &nbsp;She is from Maryland, came to Oregon to go to OSU and stayed, got married and then divorced 13 years later.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the afternoon I got more leaves from Jason and then Hb and I went for a short walk around the block. &nbsp;Along the way we saw Karen Mayo and spoke to her for a bit. &nbsp;It started to rain at the corner of Crystal Lake and Park so after talking to Karen we turned around and walked home. &nbsp;We also saw Will and Kathy before Karen. &nbsp;Hb went downtown with Kathy and Renee and had a pizza at Dimaggios.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the mid afternoon Hb and I drive over to the dock at the park and walked through the woods to the other side, sat on the bench at the river and then walked back. &nbsp;Hb had her Raja group come over in the evening. &nbsp;Our walk was lovely, and the day was warm and mostly sunny, unlike the forecast predicted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday 28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dinner at del Alma followed by a talk at Lasells on the Beatles followed by listening to a practice of the OSU mens and women&#39;s choir. &nbsp;The music moved me in ways that I did feel was possible. &nbsp;I appreciated more about living here and having an incredible resource like OSU and this instantiation of having music by young people that was incredible. &nbsp;The operatic solos were marvelous. &nbsp;The dinner at Del Alma was OK, &nbsp;Hb likes that place a lot more than I do; but I went along for the ride.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hb went to the coast to help Peggy clean her house. &nbsp;I went first to Les Schwab to get a new battery. &nbsp;Then I came home and had breakfast and at 11AM went to get my oil changed downtown. &nbsp;I went for a walk and spoke to some Century Link folks who told me all about how fiber optic cables are not coming to southtown. &nbsp;I came home and had a snack for lunch and then went out and did some leaves. &nbsp;I then went for a walk across Jen&#39;s field down to Renee&#39;s and around Luke&#39;s farm back through the park where I ran into Bob who was going for a walk as well. &nbsp;We had a nice chat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday 30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nice talk with John Zeuli in the morning. &nbsp;It rained in the afternoon, but at 4:30PM the skies cleared and Hb and I went for the WL Loop walk. &nbsp;We had not done that walk over at WL for quite a while. &nbsp;It slightly rained a bit on our way home.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">December 2018</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday 01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We went to the Christmas festival in Albany, it was our first time there. &nbsp;The day started out kind of dry, but got cold and cloudy as we were driving to Lebanon for Thai Food. &nbsp;Afterwards we drove up into the hills south east of Lebanon. &nbsp;We had never been up there before. &nbsp;Kind of a neat spot. &nbsp;Our drive home was as always, majestic and sublime :)... &nbsp;Earlier in the day I got a new razor at Target and we stopped by the Grocery Depot for $1 bags of red potatoes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ken came by at around 9AM just as Hb was getting ready to leave to go up to Belknap. &nbsp;We went for a walk around the park. &nbsp;It was a lovely morning. &nbsp;Southtown art walk. &nbsp;I started out at Tal and Miriam&#39;s where I met Norm. &nbsp;Then over to Jackie&#39;s house where I spoke to Emily from the Thyme garden. &nbsp;Then over to Coho where I spoke to Sandie about making your own curry paste. &nbsp;Then finally ended up at Sara Kellogg&#39;s house.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Another gorgeous sunny day. &nbsp;I worked outside and cleared out a vast majority of the poison oak on the other side of the fence. &nbsp;Since it has been freezing here, everything is dead. &nbsp;So I got on the other side and cleared out a bunch of the stuff that Ken had thrown over the fence years ago. &nbsp;I have been wanting to do that for several years. &nbsp;Phoenix came by and we hung out for a bit and then I walked him home and came back and finished up a few things just as it got dark and cold.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hb back from Belknap. &nbsp;She had a good journey with Renee and Diana and spent 2 nights in room 19. &nbsp;I worked outside in the afternoon finishing up trimming back the poison oak as well as cutting down the black berries. &nbsp;For the first time since Ken threw all of the debris into the wetlands 3 or 4 years ago, we are getting that area slightly more back to its original state.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday 05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A gorgeous sunny winter day in the Willamette Valley. &nbsp;We took the opportunity to go down to Findley NWR after lunch. &nbsp;We saw (literally) thousands of birds. &nbsp;We sat on the bench over looking the pond and basked in the sun for arout 45 minutes, lovely, sublime.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hb went to Eugene for a massage and I went food shopping in the early afternoon to VC [Vitamin Cottage] and GD [Grocery Depot]. &nbsp;After shopping at VC I walked up Beca to Kings and back. &nbsp;When I got home I had some lunch and then went back outside till dusk. &nbsp;Hb had her group over here. &nbsp;I helped Jaffer get his data on his thumb drive for the class. &nbsp;You will not see me mention this very often but Fgp rallied off yesterday&#39;s low post earnings announcement. &nbsp;The low was $.75 (75 cents) and it went back up to around a buck 30 $1.30. &nbsp;We live in an interesting world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday 07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Potluck at Diana&#39;s house. &nbsp;It was excellent. </span><span class="c9">Met John and Summer who moved into the new house on Crystal Lake. &nbsp;John went to graduate school at UNM in Archaeology and is going to Ecuador. &nbsp;Also met Jeff who is with Elizabeth who is Gloria&#39;s house mate. &nbsp;Jeff is from Albany and told me about </span><span class="c5 c9"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbroken:_A_World_War_II_Story_of_Survival,_Resilience,_and_Redemption&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1546463112319000">Unbroken</a></span><span class="c9">, he is also a web developer. &nbsp;I also met Ben and his wasband Susan. &nbsp;They were apart for 11 years and then she became his housemate recently. &nbsp;The potluck had great energy and was truly a moving experience. &nbsp;I am appreciating my life experiences more and more as time goes on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday 08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hb and I went to have lunch at the Dizzy Hen and then on to the hours exchange at the fairgrounds. &nbsp;We hung out with Will and went over to the crafts fair, and I hung out at Lee Miller&#39;s booth for awhile and spoke to him. &nbsp;We bought some jelly from Mike Beilstein.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It rained all afternoon and at dusk I walked over to the water company. &nbsp;Hb went out to Angelica&#39;s for Astrology and then to Gloria&#39;s for Tom Kenyon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Start the day off with my annual stool culture ritual. &nbsp;I don&#39;t usually note this here but for some reason it seemed appropriate. &nbsp;Went downtown to the post office and went for a walk down under the bridge. &nbsp;Turned around and headed home. &nbsp;It was a foggy morning but its going to be potentially be a nice day once the fog burns off. &nbsp;Hb and I did a huge walk down Wake Robin and out into the field and then west towards the Mary&#39;s River. &nbsp;It was our first time ever walking over there together, and my first time walking west on the dirt road. &nbsp;We discovered they had planeted hazel nut trees out at the end. &nbsp;Very cool, the land will hopefully be preserved. &nbsp;It was a gorgeous sunny, slightly chilly afternoon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hb had her Raja class, one more next week and then that is it. &nbsp;We cleaned the house today. &nbsp;I vacuumed both of my bedrooms. &nbsp;They had not been done in awhile. &nbsp;I never went outside today. &nbsp;Unusual, but the weather was rainy, windy and never good. &nbsp;There are few winter days when we never leave the house, but today was one of them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday 12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nice thai food lunch at the Woodsmen. &nbsp;Hb had yoga in the morning. &nbsp;I got my Pad thai dish and Hb got a spring roll. &nbsp;We got a side of brown rice. &nbsp;We saw Bond Starker at the restaurant. &nbsp;We then drove out to the Harris Bridge, parked at the winery, and went for a walk further up the road. &nbsp;We had never walked this way before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">More work on flickr photos as they were purchased by smug mug so lots of moving around of pics. &nbsp;In the evening we went over to Lasells for a Christmas Christian concert of 4 folks, two of whom were from Germany. &nbsp;It was a flute player on the left, the key boardist on the right and the girl and the boy in the back, wife and husband team. &nbsp;It was a free concert but they were pushing donations for their cause which is friends of the family.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday 14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hb and I walked over to the COOP. &nbsp;We saw Mark Sherman and Steve, Cheryl&#39;s housemate walk in. &nbsp;On the way home we talked to Mark for along time in front of the Bethel bus stop. &nbsp;He was on his go cart bike and he was in rare form. &nbsp;Just totally in himself and alive. &nbsp;We like Mark. &nbsp;I enjoyed the time we spent this summer at the fall festival together. &nbsp;He will have lived in the hood for 50 years next year. &nbsp;He moved into his house when he was around 21 years old. &nbsp;His father owned the house and thought he wanted to be a slum lord, but never lived there; and Mark ended up with the house. &nbsp;He told us the whole story about paying his dad twice for it, his sister&#39;s involvement etc... &nbsp;In the afternoon after that Peter came over and hung out with us for awhile. &nbsp;It was the 3 of us, and we had a nice visit together. &nbsp;I am busy sorting through my Flickr photos as they are transitioning away from Yahoo and I need to do a reorg.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday 15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hb and I went to Office Depot to look at a chair, and then we went out to lunch at Pastinis in the same shopping center as TJ&#39;s. &nbsp;We then went on to the 1st guitar winter concert at the library. &nbsp;It was a cloudy, dark day, but no rain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hb and I went over to the church on Harrison and 35th for a 3PM Christmas carol and lesson service concert. &nbsp;We had cookies afterwards and then went for a walk to the end of the dead end street. &nbsp;Hb came home and then went over to Gloria&#39;s for Tom Kenyon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Walk in the early afternoon just before it rained. &nbsp;I walked around the park on the inner path. &nbsp;Along the way I saw Mark and Joey. &nbsp;As I hit Crystal Lake I ran into Patrick and Mindy. &nbsp;We walked home and then had a nice long talk with Bob in front of our house all together. &nbsp;He is going to Iowa and then on to Florida with his sister. &nbsp;Jan came by with some Christmas cookies and I spoke to her for awhile. &nbsp;Hb went to Maria&#39;s for a reading this afternoon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hb had her last Raja group this morning. &nbsp;In the afternoon we went for a walk around the block with Jan.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday 19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hb and I went to the VC, then for a walk to the end of Beca then over to TJ&#39;s for brussel sprouts. &nbsp;We changed our trip to Ashland because of crappy weather, and are now going the day after Christmas. &nbsp;In the afternoon I went for a walk around the block and Hb went to the dentist to make sure one of her teeth was ok. &nbsp;She got an xray and everything is fine. &nbsp;I spoke to Dad in the evening, sent Stewart Cohn a birthday email, and am setting up a call to speak with Jim Sigman soon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jim and I launched the day off with a nice talk. &nbsp;We talked about his company Zoom and how incredible of an opportunity it is. &nbsp;He mentioned how you can &quot;learn&quot; from both your failures as well as your accomplishments, however those are defined. &nbsp;I worked outside in the afternoon garnishing the west bed next to Jay&#39;s house. &nbsp;Steve and I had a nice talk as I returned his containers. &nbsp;He brought us over some curry prior to his week long journey back to DC and Nashville to hang out with his daughters. &nbsp;In the evening Hb had her Tom Kenyon group at the house.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday 21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hb and I went downtown about 1:30PM and walked around the university for about an hour. &nbsp;We stopped by the MU and sat on the couches then drove downtown and went to the Greenbelt Land Trust party. &nbsp;I had a nice talk with Owen Dell and Hb and I spoke to Lee towards the end of the party who is writing a book about the south. &nbsp;We then went by the solstice party down at the shelter in the park. &nbsp;We walked back to Cheryl&#39;s with Ildi and Susan Towers and they had a big bondfire. &nbsp;We then walked over to Scott and Kathleen&#39;s. &nbsp;Roen Hogg and Greg and Maria were leaving the party so Hb and I hung out for awhile and talked to Scott. &nbsp;We got home and went to sleep around 11PM.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday 22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Breakfast at the Dizzy Hen followed by a nice walk for the first time on Botkin Road which is the road just before you head up over Mary&#39;s Peak. &nbsp;We then went by the COOP and bought some eggs. &nbsp;We had a nice talk with Dan and Amy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I went for a walk over near Pedro&#39;s mom&#39;s house. &nbsp;I walked up to the top of the hill, then down into the cemetery, then back out and up to the top of the hill. &nbsp;It started to rain on the way back down, but by then I was happy and on my way back to the car. &nbsp;Earlier I dropped off the yellow card for the PO.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phoenix came by in the morning and we went for a walk around the block. &nbsp;Then Hb and I went for a walk later in the afternoon and stopped by Jane&#39;s house and gave her Hb&#39;s medicine bag to fix. &nbsp;On my way home from Phoenix&#39;s house I stopped by Mark&#39;s house and met his nephew and I went in for a short while and visited with him and Joey. &nbsp;Cooper, Izzy, Patrick and Mindy came by and we hung outside a bit and we gave them cookies that Sarah and Anna had brought by earlier in the day. &nbsp;The gingerbread cookies were yummy with icing on them. &nbsp;We had a very nice Christmas Eve day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday 25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I cut back some black berries in the morning prior to going to Paul and Janet Hochfeld&#39;s for a lovely Christmas dinner. &nbsp;I sat next to Ruby Moon and Paul; and Lottie and David sat across from us. &nbsp;We had a very nice time together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday 26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Got up at 6:30AM, and were on the road by 8:30AM. &nbsp;It drizzled most of the way so we used the windshield wipers but it wasn&#39;t too bad. &nbsp;I got tired around the Medford area but by then we were ready for lunch at our favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. &nbsp;We did our 2 standard rest stops and then gas in Canyon City at the Arco station. &nbsp;So the journey down was just fine despite the rain. &nbsp;We checked into the Ashland Springs Hotel, the woman who checked us in, Maggie, got us an extra night so we are here for 4 nights which should be very suitable. &nbsp;We walked over to the skate park in the evening and to the end of the paved park road and back around on the trail. &nbsp;We love Ashland, and we are so lucky in our lives to have this place as our second home in OR.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday 27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Great breakfast at the hotel of bacon in the eggs, tasty potatoes, and brussel sprouts to top off the morning. &nbsp;We headed up the hill to the PCT but were turned back by a state trooper who was dealing with an accident. &nbsp;We could have gone on, but the roads were slick, it was snowing and Hb made the final call. &nbsp;We ended up hiking in our favorite spot at the bottom of the hill in the Siskyou National Monument just off Buckhorn Road. &nbsp;It was lovely. &nbsp;On the way home we stopped off at the Kart grocery store where I bought gluten free oats for a $1.26 a pound and some soup for a snack. &nbsp;It was a bacon and yellow squash, yummy. &nbsp;Then on to Sauce down the road on the same side of the street just before Market of Choice. &nbsp;We had a curry bowl and a large cabbage salad. &nbsp;We headed home and then walked around town for a bit just before calling it an evening we stopped by the COOP for a night cap :)...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday 28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A day in Jacksonville. &nbsp;We walked out towards the winery on the rails to trails to the end of the road. &nbsp;We had dinner at the asian noodle shop and then walked over to the coop for a cookie and chips. &nbsp;In the afternoon the sun shined bright. &nbsp;It was cold but sunny and the sun set was illustrious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday 29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Hb and I walked 9.3 miles today. &nbsp;After breakfast we walked all the way down B Street till it dead ends into Mountain. &nbsp;Then we made a left turn and headed into the North Mountain Park. &nbsp;It was our first time ever walking into the park. &nbsp;It was a gorgeous sunny day. &nbsp;We sat in the park on a bench with a gurgling creek behind us. &nbsp;A man from Redding, Pa. stopped by to say hi. &nbsp;He was here from Oakland, Ca. &nbsp;His daughter was getting therapy here. &nbsp;He was in the Vietnam war and was sad but happy to have someone to talk to. &nbsp;He was an older man; who did not know about OR. &nbsp;He didn&#39;t know where Corvallis was. &nbsp;Afterwards we walked to the COOP and I had a gluten free apple cinamon muffin and Hb had a cookie. &nbsp;I got some ripe bananas as well. &nbsp;We went back to the hotel, got organized as they cleaned our room for the first time since we arrived at the Ashland Springs hotel in Ashland. &nbsp;The day was in full bloom so we drove over to the Lithia Park at the end. &nbsp;We walked up the hill and past Ashland Loop all the way to Terrace and looped all the way back. &nbsp;Along the way, we sat down on a swing and at that moment Johng called. &nbsp;He was having a rough time with Reenie and wanted someone to talk to. &nbsp;Hb and I both spoke to him. &nbsp;We proceeded back down the hill back into the park and drove home. &nbsp;We had our best dinner of the trip at </span><span class="c5 c2"><a class="c4"

we really enjoyed the food. &nbsp;Afterwards we walked back downtown and made sure we topped over our 9 miles. &nbsp;A good day was had by all, the weather was chilly, sunny, and a perfect winter day just before the new Year.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday 30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Saw the </span><span class="c5 c2"><a class="c4"

the early 60&#39;s. &nbsp;A white driver drives around a black man who is a pianist. &nbsp;A marvelous movie about life in the days soon after I was born. &nbsp;Earlier in the day we hung out in our hotel, and then went out for a walk around town in the afternoon and had dinner at the COOP before the movie. &nbsp;The weather cooperated and never rained on us all day. &nbsp;We love Ashland.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday 31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Up at the usual time. &nbsp;Had our final amazing breakfast, read the paper, and packed up and was gone by 11AM. &nbsp;We drove back over the way we went the other day. &nbsp;Only this time we made it to the top and then on to K. Falls. &nbsp;The drive was as good as it gets. &nbsp;There was snow all the way to the bridge over the Klamath river. &nbsp;It wasn&#39;t too bad, too icy, and too scary. &nbsp;We just hung on to the wheel and kept going. &nbsp;There was never a car behind us the whole time from Ashland to the K Falls Bridge. &nbsp;We stopped there for awhile and took in the sun. &nbsp;It was lovely ! &nbsp;We loved hanging out at our spot there. &nbsp;We took some pictures of the river, Hb knocked some ice off the tires, and we walked a round a bit. &nbsp;Then on in to town, a nice lunch at a Thai restaurant that was across the street from the place we ate last time we were here. &nbsp;The funky old building with the yummy organic food. &nbsp;This Thai place was originally in the Bay Area and they moved it up here about 20 years ago. &nbsp;They know how to do Thai food. &nbsp;We checked into our hotel after lunch, and then went for a walk downtown. &nbsp;It was dusk turning to night on New Years Eve. &nbsp;It is supposed to be 11 degrees tonight ! &nbsp;Yowza. &nbsp;Now that is cold. &nbsp;But we tucked in a pretty nice room and our New Years was a good one. &nbsp;Best of luck in 2019, Love, Michael</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
