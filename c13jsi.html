Stopped at the Walmart in Dallas before heading on to Lincoln City where we had lunch at a nice Hawaiian restaurant. &nbsp;There was a used book store next door as well. &nbsp;Afterwards we went to the Farmer&rsquo;s Market and Hb bought some peanut brittle. &nbsp;Then on to an awesome beach just south of Lincoln City called Gleneden Beach. &nbsp;It was the nicest beach by far that we have been to in Oregon. &nbsp;It was sunny on the beach with hardly a breeze the first day of September. &nbsp;We walked for a couple of hours and then stopped by at the DQ in Toledo just east of Newport where I had a large Blizzard and Hb had a hot fudge sundae. &nbsp;Clearly, we had a great day going to the coast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Monday 02</span></p><p class="c0"><span

thing. &nbsp;We finished off our Thai food at Peter&rsquo;s house. &nbsp;If our fridge comes today, then tonight was our last dinner at Pedro&rsquo;s lovely home. &nbsp;We stayed in his house for almost exactly 6 weeks and had almost every meal there the entire time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Wednesday 04</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">We got our fridge, washer and dryer today. &nbsp;We went out to dinner at the Taco place across the street from Fred Meyer called Taqueria Alonso and had Fajitas. &nbsp;We then went out to buy a bunch of food for the house now that we have a fridge. &nbsp;Diane came over in the evening and I went on a bike ride with her and then we showed her the house.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Thursday 05</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Our first breakfast in the house ! &nbsp;Spoke to Iris on the phone. &nbsp;First mellow day at home where I felt relaxed. &nbsp;It rained for the first time since arriving in Corvallis on July 21. &nbsp;We had gotten mellow rains before but this was the first real one. &nbsp;Peter came over for dinner. &nbsp;We got our fridge yesterday and Peter was our first guest for tacos.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Friday 06</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Performance poetry in the evening at Interzone after walking around the OSU campus for the first time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Saturday 07</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Great day ! &nbsp;We started out at the Farmer&rsquo;s Market, then headed out to some garage sales. &nbsp;It was our first drive in the Country Club Neighborhood and we meandered ourselves over to Philomath after a beautiful mexican lunch at the Safeway shopping center. &nbsp;We ended up at Betty and Cliff&rsquo;s farm for some great vegetables and conversation. &nbsp;They have a gorgeous 80 acre farm. &nbsp;We bought tomatoes for $1 per pound and got some real nice celery. &nbsp;In the evening we went to Steve&rsquo;s party. &nbsp;Where we met his friends and cohorts from work. &nbsp;I also learned that he is from Monongahela.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Sunday 08</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Drive up to Albany to check out some garage sales. &nbsp;Stopped by the train station. &nbsp;You can park there as long as you like for free. &nbsp;Took the back road home, so we bagged another road. &nbsp;Went for a walk in the park in the evening and hung out at the bench. &nbsp;We love that spot there, and are very happy to be here in Corvallis.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Monday 09</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Disaster day with the internet but in the end, like most of the times, life gets settled into place. &nbsp;The guy arrived at the house at 5PM, and by dark at around 8PM the internet was fixed. &nbsp;I knew the guy knew what he was doing. &nbsp;Peter also came over for dinner and Hb made a fantastic chicken soup.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Tuesday 10</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Peter came over for dinner again and we had chicken soup. &nbsp;An hour earlier I walked over to the farm stand and met Elias who said I could do compost at his farm stand across the street from our field.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Wednesday 11</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Two very interesting things happened today on the 12th anniversary of 9/11. &nbsp;The most important being the movie I saw about how to demolish buildings and actually get away with it. &nbsp;The second interesting point highly related to point 1 is that when Steve Jobs died at his memorial service he passed out a book about the Autobiography of a Yogi. &nbsp;This is significant because it empowers the individual to be stronger and actualize their life in a most important fashion. &nbsp;Also, on this day I spoke to United Airlines and they told me that if I order one magazine, Fast Company, that they would extend my mileage agreement with them for another 18 months.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Thursday 12</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Got library cards at both OSU and the Corvallis public library. &nbsp;Parked in our usual spot on 11th between Madison and Monroe. &nbsp;First stop was the ice cream store, then on to the OSU library where I picked up two books on Cell Signalling. &nbsp;In the evening we ran into Joan at her house on Crystal Lake and she showed us her backyard. &nbsp;I also learned for the first time that the name of those big trees are called Mountain Sequoias. &nbsp;She told us they were planted in the 60&rsquo;s and now they are giant trees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Friday 13</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">In the evening we drove out to the Mary&rsquo;s River and walked up the hill near the cemetery. &nbsp;It was our first time walking around the country club neighborhood. &nbsp;Peter&rsquo;s parents put an offer in on a house close by here too. &nbsp;We drove out 53rd for the first time to where the Mary&rsquo;s river crosses the road.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Saturday 14</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Bought some buckets at a garage sale exactly in the same spot we were last evening, and bought more outside chairs. &nbsp;Then I took a ride out to the end of Kiger Island Drive. &nbsp;It was my second time out there, the first time I drove. &nbsp;This is a fantastic place to go for a bike ride. &nbsp;Afterwards I picked up some nuts. &nbsp;On the drive out Kiger Island I saw giant wooden boxes full of nuts, so now is the time to get them. &nbsp;Peter came over for dinner and we had tacos. &nbsp;In the morning we went to the Farmer&rsquo;s Market and got some good food for the week.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Sunday 15</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Awesome day on Shotpouch creek. &nbsp;In the morning we hung out at home and relaxed and then in the early afternoon headed over to the Lumos Winery. &nbsp;From there they took us up to Shotpouch creek and we visited four sites where they were doing creek restoration. &nbsp;The country is beautiful and the mist and intermittent rain made for a gorgeous day in the Oregon coastal range. &nbsp;Afterwards we went back to the winery for a nice meeting and potluck dinner. &nbsp;We got home just at dark.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Monday 16</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">I went for a bike ride in the afternoon around the park and then halfway down Kiger Island. &nbsp;For dinner we went to Magenta with Peter&rsquo;s parents. &nbsp;We had dim sum which was very yummy. &nbsp;Afterwards they came back to our house to hang out for awhile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Tuesday 17</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">For the first time in many years I went for a run starting at the south side of the Williamette forest near my bench and trying to run north to the rocks. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t quite make it. &nbsp;Dinner at Peter&rsquo;s house with his parents. &nbsp;I love Peter&rsquo;s parents. &nbsp;They are very nice people and I consider them good friends of mine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Wednesday 18</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Hung out with Peter&rsquo;s parents at the end of the day. &nbsp;They are heading back home tomorrow morning. &nbsp;They bought a house in three days and headed back home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Thursday 19</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">We cut the grass this afternoon. &nbsp;Prior to that I went for a bike ride over to Avery Park for the first time and rode down to the golf course which is adjacent to the Mary&rsquo;s River. &nbsp;Would be a cool place to walk around at night or in the winter when no one is there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Friday 20</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Spoke to Scott Friedman for the first time in awhile. &nbsp;He dropped Velocity in Argentina and uses Odesk and Elance as his primary vehicle to pay people. &nbsp;Both companies charge around a 10% service fee to get them the money. &nbsp;Its actually a pretty nice business model. &nbsp;In the evening we headed out to the Unitarian Church to hear a talk on Evolution vs Creationism. &nbsp;It was our first time to that church and it was pretty interesting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Saturday 21</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Farmer&rsquo;s Market in the morning followed by lunch at the coop. &nbsp;They had tons of free food for the harvest festival. &nbsp;Today is the first day of autumn and it was a full moon too. &nbsp;In the afternoon we hit some garage sales and hung out at the nice park at the top of the hill where Circle Drive ends. &nbsp;Hb talked to Gabe and I walked around a bit loving the surroundings. &nbsp;In the evening Peter came over for dinner and we had cider and gluten free beer along with hamburgers and a bunch of tapas Hb and I fired up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Sunday 22</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Went to a nice play with Peter called </span><span class="c1 c3 c2 c8">Love Letters</span><span class="c1 c2">&nbsp;at the Majestic Theatre for the first time. &nbsp;Afterwards, we had a nice dinner here of zucchini patties with eggs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Monday 23</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Ruth and Chris came over from athomeinoregon.com. &nbsp;It was a pretty rainy day so I stayed home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Tuesday 24</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Interesting day with Rick Funke at his Essential Oils farm. &nbsp;We just luckily ran into him as we were walking down near Kiger Island. &nbsp;He showed us his &ldquo;barn&rdquo; and all of his gorgeous cars as well as his dance hall filled with old slot machines.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Wednesday 25</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Early morning walk over to Peter&rsquo;s. &nbsp;It was a bit more sunny in the morning with blue sky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Thursday 26</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Trash at dusk and hang at Peter&rsquo;s house till about 8:30PM. &nbsp;Earlier in the day Hb and I took the bus for the first time over to OSU. &nbsp;We walked west on campus to 30th, which is a nice tree lined street and then back east on Campus way cutting over to Monroe just east of the Yogurt store and the Interzone. &nbsp;In town, we went to the nice bookstore with lots of chairs and I read about the history of Oregon, the Columbia river, and hiking trails in Corvallis. &nbsp;The weather has definitely shifted to autumn weather with bouts of rain throughout the day. &nbsp;We like autumn here, but it gets cold about a month earlier than NM.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Friday 27</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Great walk down in Eugene starting at 20th and Lawrence at Washington Park and walked over to the first place I visited in Eugene on the first day with Pedro and Michael at the Tea House which is on Friendly street. &nbsp;This area between Wash Park and the Tea house is the nicest part of Eugene besides the Emerald park hood in the northern part of town. &nbsp;Afterwards we went over to the stadium and walked into town across the bridge and through campus. &nbsp;It was our first time eating at the Thai restaurant on Oak and 13th. &nbsp;It was yummy. &nbsp;Afterwards we walked a bit through the rain and then home. &nbsp;I did a bit of work in the evening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Saturday 28</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Farmer&rsquo;s market in the morning. &nbsp;Went for a walk around the park in the early afternoon and got to watch the boys play rugby. &nbsp;This is a very cool sport ! &nbsp;I remember it from back in the days at Lville but this seemed even more cool. &nbsp;Came home and cooked some pizza and then had Diane, Kerry, and Peter over for dinner. &nbsp; We had spring rolls, salad, pizza and Peter brought ice cream and cookies for dessert. &nbsp;It was the first party at our house since buying the house almost one month ago.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Sunday 29</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">It started raining last night and rained all day today until the time we went to sleep. &nbsp;I have NEVER seen this in my life. &nbsp;A continuous rain for over 24 hours.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Monday 30</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">At 8AM I went out and caught the bus into town. &nbsp;It rained all day yesterday and Saturday evening so I was ready to go when I saw it wasn&rsquo;t raining. &nbsp;I walked up Western a bit and then up 7th to the bus station, and then back and then walked all the way home. &nbsp;Then around the park. &nbsp;Today I think I decided NOT to rent out the house. &nbsp;I want to live here, and don&rsquo;t mind the rain too much. &nbsp;Talked to Tessie, she is going to the Philippines for around one month leaving Oct 12, coming back Nov 08. &nbsp;Also talked to Iris.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1 c2"></span></p><p

walk into town in the afternoon. &nbsp;We hang out at the bookstore and then walk back home. &nbsp;On our way home the weather was simply superb, clear, crisp with a bright blue sky. &nbsp;We had a nice chicken soup for dinner that Hb made earlier in the day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Wednesday 02</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Walked into town around 3PM and went to the bank. &nbsp;Then stopped by the Coop on the way home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Thursday 03</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Pretty mellow day at work. &nbsp;Walk in the afternoon around the park. &nbsp;Stopped off at Peter&rsquo;s to do the trash. &nbsp;Talked to Andy in the evening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Friday 04</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Breakfast in Springfield at The Pump restaurant downtown Springfield on 7th street. &nbsp;We then drove up to Belknap Hot Springs. &nbsp;We hung out for awhile and walked over to the Secret Garden. &nbsp;It was sunny and we sat in the sun there for awhile. &nbsp;Then we went to dinner down the road at the only restaurant in the area called Takoda&rsquo;s. &nbsp;Then back and did a hot tub till dusk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Saturday 05</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Got up and Hb did a hot tub and I walked down the trail between Belknap and the place where I started two days from now on Monday. &nbsp;Its just past Boulder Creek and over the bridge of the McKenzie river to the other side towards Sister&rsquo;s. &nbsp;We then drove into Sister&rsquo;s via the OLD Highway 242. &nbsp;We stopped at Proxy Falls and walked to them. &nbsp;Then stopped at the Dee Observatory at the summit of McKenzie Pass and looked out. &nbsp;The day was so clear we saw Mt. Hood in the viewfinder. &nbsp;Lunch at Angeline&rsquo;s bakery then on to the Mill Inn in Bend. &nbsp;We walked along the river to downtown and had dinner at a nice Vietnamese restaurant. &nbsp;It was fall fest in Bend and we walked around listened to music and talked to folks and sampled cider and vodka. &nbsp;We walked home in the dark as dinner was over after it turned dark. &nbsp;We stopped at an old interesting building on the way home which is now a restaurant pub but at the time may have been an old school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Sunday 06</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Up very early at 5AM and drove east towards Burns. &nbsp;I drove for about 30 miles. &nbsp;This was a very cool drive. &nbsp;Then looped back to the south and north on 97. &nbsp;Breakfast was awesome. &nbsp;David is the executive chef and managed The Mill Inn for 3 years after the owner got cancer and died. &nbsp;She left her place to the Community College and they sold it to a new owner. &nbsp;Next time you go back make sure David is still the cook before booking a room. &nbsp;Afterwards we drove west of town into the hills and then over to Whole Foods. &nbsp;From there we went for a hike just north of town on the river. &nbsp;Then up to Sisters for a late lunch at Angeline&rsquo;s Bakery. &nbsp;Got to Belknap Hot Springs in one hour from Bend. &nbsp;We went for a walk over the bridge and to the left and walked to the dead end. &nbsp;We couldn&rsquo;t walk any more. &nbsp;Then we did a hot tub at dusk and met a guy who worked on the dam and told us all about electric power and how it works and is regulated. &nbsp;He lives in Leaburg after Springfield at the Dam.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Monday 07</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">It was raining in the morning and I went for a walk by driving up past Boulder Creek and turning left, crossing the McKenzie River and parking right away. &nbsp;It is the first left turn past Belknap Hot Springs and the next spot on the McKenzie Trail where it crosses the river. &nbsp;I walked up the road and then on to the trail where the road sort of ended and walked up to the next creek where the trail went over a bridge. &nbsp;Next time I will walk from the other way to this point to continue walking the whole trail. &nbsp;Went into Eugene and had Thai food at our restaurant on Oak. &nbsp;Then shopped for shoes for Hb downtown and at RiverCenter. &nbsp;We had popcorn at home for dinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Tuesday 08</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Made reservation to go home on Saturday Nov 02. &nbsp;Went to Home Depot to buy a combo lock for the front door, followed by the food shopping circuit. &nbsp;In the late afternoon I went over to the Tuesday Farmer&rsquo;s Market and talked to Elias about knowing Noel and Zoe. &nbsp;At first I had forgotten his name, but then I went back to tell him what it was. &nbsp;In the evening I went over to Peter&rsquo;s house to hang out for awhile and talk about the dry side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Wednesday 09</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Went back to Home Depot to return our computer front door lock as we decided this was too high tech for our needs at the moment. &nbsp;Maybe in the spring we will do it. &nbsp;Then onto Chip Ross Park for a gorgeous hike. It was our first time there. &nbsp;Then a great early dinner at our favorite mexican restaurant. &nbsp;Then to Peter&rsquo;s parents house to get some final autumn food from his parents garden. &nbsp;In the early evening we went for a walk in the park next to the park and met Jimmy Bates of Fifgen Films.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Thursday 10</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Home Depot late in the day to buy a Schlage deadbolt. &nbsp;Awesome </span><span class="c1 c2 c9"><a class="c6" href="http://dorothyspctblog.blogspot.com/">talk</a></span><span class="c1

in the evening went for a walk on the other side of 3rd. &nbsp;It was our first time discovering all of the apartments on the other side of the Hwy 99.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Saturday 12</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Great day in Salem. &nbsp;Started out driving north to Independence. &nbsp;Went to a nice book store in Independence and the Farmer&rsquo;s market there as well. &nbsp;Then onto Salem for the first time via Orville Road. &nbsp;On the way we discovered an estate sale where I bought over 10 items including shirts and jackets. &nbsp;Then on to the Vitamin Cottage and lunch at &ldquo;Word of Mouth&rdquo;. &nbsp;Afterward we walked around downtown Salem. &nbsp;I had a macaroon at the bakery shop where the guy made cookies in a small pizza
