minutes, that was it.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c0">Wednesday 17</span></p><p class=""><span class="c0">Day 1 of my new life and my new job. &nbsp;Focus today was ML. &nbsp;Will be one of the things I pursue besides search, Python and Golang.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c0">Friday 19</span></p><p class=""><span class="c0">Start looking at Gensim.</span></p><p class=""><span

this evening from Abq. &nbsp;Up and running with Tensorflow. &nbsp;Not able to build it from scratch, but able to run all of the examples in the {contrib, example, python} directories. &nbsp;In the early afternoon I was pretty bummed out as I could not get it to build from src, but by the end of the day I was happy when I was able to run everything in the above 3 directories including the tests. &nbsp;So I am now pretty much all set with Python, all I have to do now is understand gensim and tensorflow better, write some code for practice and then move on to Golang. &nbsp;At that point, I should be able to start going out and talking to people about jobs and seeing what is available.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c0">Thursday 25</span></p><p class=""><span class="c0">Took the day off and went to Newport with Jason and went for a boat ride out on the ocean.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c0">Friday 26</span></p><p class=""><span class="c0">Started working on gonum and golearn which uses gonum. &nbsp;It wasn&#39;t a real productive day but it appears from first passing that golearn in particular is no longer being developed in a serious way meaning that the repo is basically dead. &nbsp;Will monitor closely over the next number of months and see what happens.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c0">Saturday 27</span></p><p class=""><span class="c0">Taking a look at noms. Day 1 of noms is official, keep going.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c0">Monday 29</span></p><p class=""><span class="c0">Day 2 of Noms and up and running on their Slack channel.</span></p><p class=""><span class="c0">Wednesday 31</span></p><p class=""><span class="c0">Day 4 of Noms and I pretty much have the code base figured out. &nbsp;Today I reviewed how the data is being persisted to

anticipation of possibly writing another backend store to Bolt. &nbsp;But in further review I decided not to. &nbsp;Leveldb is so clean, and the transactions are covered magically in their code base. &nbsp;Where as Bolt requires some transaction management which would add complexity to the back end store. &nbsp;Today I also reviewed the final two Noms packages I had not yet covered including {dataset, types}. &nbsp;&quot;</span><span class="c0 c9">A dataset is nothing more than a named pointer into the DAG</span><span class="c0">.&quot; &nbsp;Types is much more involved and the most interesting and complex part of the code base. &nbsp;Everything else is pretty straight forward. &nbsp;More notes on types but for now it looks like there are native types and user contructed types and that all types implement the Value Interface.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class=""><span class="c0 c2">September</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p

&nbsp;Got the whole angular side working today after one long day of effort yesterday. &nbsp;So we are back up and running with Angular. &nbsp;Also made an </span><span class="c0 c2">executive decision</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;yesterday to stick with Angular 1 for now until there is a pressing reason to upgrade. &nbsp;I spent some time on Angular 2 which was released </span><span

ago</a></span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;Its not ready for prime time and there is just too much momentum behind Angular 1, so for now just stick with that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class=""><span class="c0">Also, I got an email a few days back from Clara in China and she got me back into looking at the blockchain, decred and Ethereum. &nbsp;Once the

Angular side of the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class=""><span class="c0">Friday 04</span></p><p class=""><span class="c0">Last night at 3AM I discovered that raft, the concept of consensus is tightly related to the whole future work of the block chain. &nbsp;Also, the universe, with Clara as the catalyst and driver has gotten me naturally back into looking at the blockchain. &nbsp;It makes sense, you were heavily involved and invested in Noms but this concept is actually real, up and running and viable from a business point of view. &nbsp;Also, spending more time on Angular is a must, as I need a UI. &nbsp;I always have and I always will and this time around Angular just feels more right and simple for me to understand especially now that I have the block explorer up and running and talking to Ethereum and after reviewing the source code of it, and seeing how simple it is, gives me the incentive and passion to pursue down a parallel path of both the UI and the back end.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class=""><span class="c0">Sunday 06</span></p><p class=""><span class="c0">Understand RLP encoding in the context of the

class="c0">Wednesday 23</span></p><p class=""><span class="c0">I want to write Hackernews json files out to redis, leveldb, and bolt using the Hackernoms concurrency infrastructure. &nbsp;So first I need to get Redis and Bolt back ends working with Noms again. &nbsp;Then once this is mostly complete I can use the same basic interface to write the json files to the 3 storage units.</span></p><p

class="c0">Spoke to aa and rafael about chunkstore and batchstore. &nbsp;rafael asked me to help out with the concept of removing dependency on spec for adding new backend stores. &nbsp;I got the boltstore working with the noms {log, show} commands. &nbsp;This was a big breakthrough for me in general understanding of the spec and verifying the idea of using the dataset as the bolt bucket is going to work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class=""><span class="c0">Wednesday 07</span></p><p class=""><span class="c0">The major focus the past couple of days has been to get the noms diff command working on bolt. &nbsp;The big problem has been that I was trying to open a bolt file a second time and it was locking. &nbsp;So I came to the conclusion that the easiest way to work with bolt is to &quot;open, {read,write}, close&quot;. &nbsp;Yesterday I also found the spec tests which led me to a better understanding of where the localdatabase, batchstore, legacy term datastore etc. all works.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class=""><span class="c0">Chinese folks pinged me this morning that they were here and wanted to come down to Corvallis. &nbsp;I called Peter and he vehemently vetoed the idea. &nbsp;And the universe looked down on us and later in the day they got back to me and said they were not coming. &nbsp;I got lucky. &nbsp;Moving forward the only way I will work with them is if I am interacting with an English speaking programmer who is fluent in Chinese.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p
