looking at the blockchain. &nbsp;It makes sense, you were heavily involved and invested in Noms but this concept is actually real, up and running and viable from a business point of view. &nbsp;Also, spending more time on Angular is a must, as I need a UI. &nbsp;I always have and I always will and this time around Angular just feels more right and simple for me to understand especially now that I have the block explorer up and running and talking to Ethereum and after reviewing the source code of it, and seeing how simple it is, gives me the incentive and passion to pursue down a parallel path of both the UI and the back end.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday Nov 06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Understand RLP encoding in

spent either in Henley land messing around with Ruby and or Golang afterwards. &nbsp;It was the need to be able to deal with, compile, and deploy contracts to Ethererum which got me back into the Nodejs, Javascript game. &nbsp;And so today I dove back into callbacks, promises etc....</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">March</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday Mar 02, 2017</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I am cranking along on the Solidity contracts, searching for examples that make the most sense for me to master and discovered the 3 examples on the Ethereum website. &nbsp;So now I am going to use those to implement them in Truffle and write my unit tests which should give me the confidence to move forward on being an &quot;expert&quot; in Solidity contracts with something that is relevant to what I am doing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span

I just needed to focus on the core Solidity code that will get me up to speed on what I need to know along with the Truffle Testing framework to make sure I understand how to do the testing correctly of the contracts. &nbsp;Being able to really hit and test the contracts hard is mission critical to what I will be doing moving forward in the contract space.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday March 08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beginning of the week was all about a deep dive into Web3.js and Testrpc. &nbsp;Lots more work to to on Testrpc but at least I have a decent handle on what Web3.js is all about. &nbsp;Now I am back into cranking out more working Truffle contracts and if need be, will look into Testrpc and Web3 to help debug getting running examples delivered to Github.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday March 09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Going back and re-reading the complete Solidity documentation set from the top now that I have a better handle on what is going on. &nbsp;I did this with Truffle recently and it all made more sense to me the second time I read it. &nbsp;I also got the Solidity docs now on one HTML page and one PDF document which makes it easier to read and review. &nbsp;Will use the examples in the doc to drive all of my Truffle examples for now. &nbsp;Once this is done and I complete the testrpc and web3.js stuff I should be in really good shape and could actually possibly get back into doing some Go coding again. &nbsp;At that point I will be ready to look for a new job.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday March 16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Huge progress on Truffle and reading through the solidity docs including writing contracts having to do with Structs, Arrays, and Mappings. &nbsp;Based on completion of this work I am now ready to go out and start looking for a job in the area of working in Ethereum in coincidence with the Ether price going from 10 to 40 in the past 2 weeks. &nbsp;We live in interesting times.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday March 17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Day 1 of looking for a job on

to you. &nbsp;There is no hurry to take the first job that comes along unless it makes sense to you and feels right. &nbsp;For example, after reading through Deepak Rao from Pivotchain&#39;s About Us/You website blurb I decided to not even talk to him until I get back from Nashville.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Also, had the final 3rd talk with Jack du Rose, it went well. &nbsp;He is an interesting guy as well. &nbsp;So now I have spoken with all 3 of the 4 co-founders.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday March 23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Another round of speaking with Dotun from Ownage this time with a more technical bent to it. &nbsp;I reviewed Swagger / the Open API spec for the first time and that was the fuel from which I started my diatribe and speech about my technical knowledge. &nbsp;We continue to live in interesting times.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday March 26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tomorrow we go to Portland and Tuesday we go to Nashville. &nbsp;I am in pretty good shape all around for looking for a job. &nbsp;Solidity contracts round one are in good shape. &nbsp;Yesterday, I dove into Gnosis and realized its not yet ready for prime time. &nbsp;Lots of interpendencies and compilation issues with include files, it took me several hours to evaluate and give it a NO for now. &nbsp;But it was an interesting experience in looking at bigger projects surrounding contracts. &nbsp;Probably lots of useful info in there. &nbsp;So now we kick back go on vacation, and come back ready to talk to more companies after doing a first round with Ownage as the basis for thinking once again about looking for work and a path forward with my new venture. &nbsp;I will update here with my thoughts from Nashville and what I am working on there in preparation for another round of talking to folks after my return. &nbsp;Continue to do your meditation, stay calm, and realize how lucky and fortunate you are to be in this position.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span

took from the time we were in Chico till now which is approximately six weeks. &nbsp;And with this knowledge I can go out and start talking to people about work, but at the same time I can now circle back with a complete picture and move forward in areas that make sense for better understanding. &nbsp;I am off to Nashville, the next note will be from there and a path forward.</span></p><p

Dotun this morning at Ownage, looks like I have a green light. &nbsp;Had I not heard back from Ownage I was going to spend my time in Nashville looking into the Noms NBS code base so I could report

looking at the Javascript version of libp2p and at the end of the day started looking at the go version of libp2p and am literally stunned at the ease of programming in Go compared to the FUCKING UGLY callback hell that Javascript has to offer. &nbsp;It is just pathetically overly complicated, and for me a SHOW stopper. &nbsp;I need to be able to read and understand the JS but actually having to write JS code professionaly is not that appealing. &nbsp;Its just not worth the callback BS you have to deal with. &nbsp;In the past number of weeks I got away from JS by diving into the contract stuff, which is reasonable and then for the past 2 weeks in Nashville exclusively looking at JS code and being stumped by hard it is, and then tonight looking at the Go code again after being away from it for awhile and going this is so much cleaner and easier to understand and write.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am glad I spent the past couple of weeks programming and looking at the JS code prior to possibly accepting a job with Ownage and I believe the fact that I didn&#39;t get the offer letter today because of the time difference and then spending all day on the JS code and at the end of the day looking at the go code gave me a respite from possibly making the wrong decision. &nbsp;As well as my gut has continued to tell me that its not the right job, despite the fact that these guys seem pretty cool is a good sign not to go with it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This possibly reopens the idea of taking another look at the Noms code as well as the libp2p code on the Go side of the world. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p

hint</a></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fact that the Noms folks completely dropped their Javascript version of Noms after more than a year of work on it says alot. &nbsp;Here are some very bright programmers, who used to work at Google, who are productive Go programmers saying its just not worth it. &nbsp;For me, its an executive decision. &nbsp;For me, I was lucky to go down the path of Javscript for 2 weeks in Nashville and just cut my losses and move on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it all came to me this evening, when I went back to look at the Go code and saw that its just a cleaner simpler language. &nbsp;However, I did learn that being able to read and understand Javascript is very important, its just not the language of choice for writing professional code. &nbsp;Period, end of story. &nbsp;AND going forward long term, why not make the decision now, be confident with it, and move on...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday April 19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">And

of Redux in relationship to Redis on the server side. &nbsp;This was in the context of the Hnapi that uses Express with Redis as the cache. &nbsp;These 2 topics are orthogonal and I didn&#39;t realize how these pieces really fit together to now. &nbsp;Also was exposed to </span><span class="c6 c5"><a class="c11"

&nbsp;When I first looked at it I did not understand why this was important. &nbsp;But as I further pondered, think of millions of clients out there hanging off a set of web servers. &nbsp;In the react world each has a different state system in their Redux. &nbsp;That is not related in any way to Redis. &nbsp;I was trying to store that state in Redis which makes no sense. &nbsp;The idea would be to think about which parameters you want their session to store, think banking application or trading application but not store the entire state which is what Redux does. &nbsp;So all of these ideas are coming into my head and I am starting to appreciate why Node.js / Express is such an important concept to be an expert in / with the relationship to know where Redis fits into the picture and where Redux fits into the picture.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday Aug 2</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Heavily into Redux

table ecosystem of saving data to redis and mongodb, a front end inventory control system, and a back end receipt system showing the receipts from each checkout. &nbsp;In other words a complete store. &nbsp;And this will enable other table driven concepts like buying and selling financial instruments and keeping track of the orders, and showing monthly statements etc. &nbsp;This is simple minded stuff, but great infrastructure code to better acquaint yourself with all of the issues surrounding redux, reactabular, mongodb, redis, react.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p

a few months once he hires his FIRST engineer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday September 19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Spoke to Fabio from Tesorio, he grew up in Albuquerque and went to the Academy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday September 20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It took me about 20 days to fully get receipt up and running. &nbsp;But at around 4PM today I finished this project. &nbsp;I basically started working on this project on August 9; and last night I had a big breakthrough on how the flow of redux works. &nbsp;The event fires and updates the state tree and you connect the change in the state tree of redux to your react components. &nbsp;And in summary, it took me months to digest and get this very simple point. &nbsp;But last night I think I finally got it and understand. &nbsp;And that led to the conclusion of my receipt project today.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday Sep 21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Deployed receipt to gh-pages via create-react-script which is very cool. &nbsp;Also got my Marionette Backbone Jobs repo back up and running on stormasm.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday Sep 22, 2017</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Begin working on d3 project and coming back up to speed on d3. &nbsp;Back on May 2 when I initially launched into this whole React ecosystem you will note from my log that my whole intention initially was to possibly work on d3 as well. &nbsp;And here we are almost 5 months later having completed the initial groundwork with React and so part two in this whole react roll out is to look at d3 and possibly other graph visualization libraries. &nbsp;Now that the receipt work is done, it was a moment to ponder and choose my next step and part of me once again considered the whole ethereum world with truffle, but for now, unless I get hired by someone doing crypto I am going to move forward with graphs and data visualization.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wed Sep 27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I got the concept of a menu up and running using pure.css. &nbsp;React Router is well understood now as well. &nbsp;When I upgraded react-redux-d3 from the old code to the new I needed to learn about react-router as they changed the way the code worked in V4. &nbsp;So I blended react-router with pure menus in my new aspen release. &nbsp;Also, I understand the concept of a Navbar and what it is in the concept of the refresh button which must stay at the top even as the D3 graphs scroll down the page forever. &nbsp;The Navbar concept is pretty cool. &nbsp;Yet another reason to be up to speed on how CSS works, as it is a mission critical piece of the &quot;front end&quot; puzzle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday Oct 3, 2017</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So we are now on to my first D3 framework which is called Semiotic. &nbsp;Its a good one and the author is good too. &nbsp;He wrote a book on D3, he works at Netflix and his code is good. &nbsp;And I discovered yesterday he is using Material Design React components for the CSS layer. &nbsp;Very cool. &nbsp;I like the menu folding concept, it just feels right to me. &nbsp;So moving forward the CSS design concept along with D3 as the application is a good combination. &nbsp;Move foward with data visualization, React, D3 and CSS. &nbsp;Do not do Python for now. &nbsp;That is on the back burner until after you land your first job doing front end development, unless someone wants to hire me to write Python code. &nbsp;Also, spoke to Habib Moody yesterday from Literably. &nbsp;I told him I wanted a job and not to be a one off worker for his pet project of statistics on his data in a 50 table Postgresql db getting it via Python.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday October 11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So we are hard at work on understanding Semiotic. &nbsp;Both as an end user and as a developer. &nbsp;On the developer side of the world I am now in good shape with understanding how everything is Frame and that XY, OR, and Network all return a Frame so when you look at the HTML you simply see a frame. &nbsp;Today I started getting into the individual D3 packages that are used by semiotic. &nbsp;This is a HUGE ball of wax and one that will take months to truly understand. &nbsp;So don&#39;t get too defocused on D3 in and of itself but be slightly more general with React and then have D3 as a speciality. &nbsp;So I guess that is true for all of the data visualization field.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday October 12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Starting down the uber road of react-vis and their whole testing framework of their react components.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday October 29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">So we are getting ready to leave for Ashland and I wanted to do a quick update prior to leaving. &nbsp;So I have spent the past several weeks coming up to speed on the docs folder of material-ui which will be one of my core platforms going forward upon which to build nice new websites that can be deployed to gh-pages. &nbsp;The architecture is very clean, simple and easy to understand and is based on </span><span class="c6 c5"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/zeit/next.js&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1514775727773000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF57nSP0zH5agDkdZtHC_T1LsOO-w">Next.js</a></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c6 c5"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://cssinjs.org&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1514775727773000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDA-iQ--PhO0sEcydJ4Wy3GRiNNQ">JSS</a></span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;My strategy to date has been to use D3 as my application layer upon which to develop an underlying core infrastructure initially based on the Semiotic custom framework but once I discovered that Semiotic was using Material-ui and that Material-ui was using Next.js it just all came together. &nbsp;So the next step from here is fairly obvious. &nbsp;Continue to get better at understanding both D3 and the CSS framework JSS and how it integrates all sorts of different D3 Css concepts inside the stylyzed component hierarchy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday November 17, 2017</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">So for the past couple of weeks I have been working on react-vis and coming more up to speed on d3. &nbsp;Yesterday I discovered vx after going through the code of all of the the react d3 repos </span><span class="c6 c5"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/stormasm/awesome-d3-react&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1514775727774000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFYe_3hLF1Wnh60N9egWWOziimCwQ">in my list</a></span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;It took me awhile to get here to understand what is going on; and it took me looking deeply into d3 and what the frameworks are actually providing. &nbsp;Vx appears to be the most low level framework plus it is written by a guy who knows what he is doing as he wrote the Javascript guide at Airbnb. &nbsp;I have come to the conclusion that semiotic is too much and too complicated from a code point of view. &nbsp;Vx seems to be at the right level of complexity and is close to the SVG spec and the D3 Api. &nbsp;So over the past 2 weeks in Ashland I have honed a bit more my skill set with D3 and continued to put more emphasis in getting better at D3 development in concert with its integration into React.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c9">This is where I finish up the understanding of material-ui and start building things for it using graphql as the query language to get interesting data and put something into a website.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday December 11, 2017</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I recently made 2 commits to material-ui which is kind of cool. &nbsp;I am up to speed on material-ui. &nbsp;I feel good about it. &nbsp;The next step is a conscious fork in the road. &nbsp;I could either dive deeper into material-ui or I could take all of my knowledge and start to build something. &nbsp;Something real, something that is kind of interesting and will leverage my react / d3 skillset to show something that I am interested in. &nbsp;My first foray into this will be taking another look at graphql.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wed Dec 13, 2017</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Started working on parsing markdown with the goal of grabbing a bunch of github links from awesome github repos Readme.md files.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday Dec 14, 2017</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Continue on the Markdown parsing strategy. &nbsp;Found Markdown-it, and I will use this code to drive myself forward. &nbsp;Yesterday I took a look at marked first and then found markdown-it at the end of the day and it is further along, in continual development and is much more clearly documented on how it works. &nbsp;Stay tuned.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday Dec 19, 2017</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It will be a week by the time Markdown is in good shape, but I am not yet completed building out the link filter. &nbsp;I am making better progress now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday Dec 25, 2017</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Markdown is in good shape almost. &nbsp;I now have all of the github repos from the original markdown file and have regexed out all the stuff I do not want. &nbsp;It took less than 2 weeks to get here. &nbsp;So the markdown tangent was not in vain and did not waste too much time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday Dec 26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Markdown project is done and I now have all of the github repo urls I want for now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday Dec 27, 2017</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">First time

Dec 29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Figured out the forking model in codesandbox. &nbsp;Also, got all of the mui-demos in one github repo. &nbsp;Very cool. &nbsp;No longer need to haul around all of the other crap associated with running the demo.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday Dec 31, 2017</span></p><p class="c1"><span
